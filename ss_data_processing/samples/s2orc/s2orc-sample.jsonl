NRC-1 could express a cassette containing test sequences of SIVmac gag derived DNA, and function as an antigen display/delivery system. Tests using mice indicated that the humoral immune response to the gag encoded sequences evoked immunologic memory in the absence of an exogenous adjuvant.Results:The goal of this research was to extend this demonstration to diverse gene sequences by testing recombinant gas vesicles displaying peptides encoded by different SIV genes (SIV tat, rev or nef ). Verification that different peptides can be successfully incorporated into the GvpC surface protein of gas vesicle would support a more general biotechnology application of this potential display/ delivery system. Selected SIVsm-GvpC fusion peptides were generated by creating and expressing fusion genes, then assessing the resulting recombinant gas vesicles for SIV peptide specific antigenic and immunogenic capabilities. Results from these analyses support three conclusions: (i) Different recombinant gvpC-SIV genes will support the biosynthesis of chimeric, GvpC fusion proteins which are incorporated into the gas vesicles and generate functional organelles. (ii) Monkey antibody elicited by in vivo infection with SHIV recognizes these expressed SIV sequences in the fusion proteins encoded by the gvpC-SIV fusion genes as SIV peptides. (iii) Test of antiserum elicited by immunizing mice with recombinant gas vesicles demonstrated notable and long term antibody titers. The observed level of humoral responses, and the maintenance of elevated responses to, Tat, Rev and Nef1 encoded peptides carried by the respective r-GV, are consistent with the suggestion that in vivo there may be a natural and slow release of epitope over time.Conclusion:The findings therefore suggest that in addition to providing information about these specific inserts, r-GV displaying peptide inserts from other relevant pathogens could have significant biotechnological potential for display and delivery, or serve as a cost effective initial screen of pathogen derived peptides naturally expressed during infections in vivo.\n\nBackground\n\nThe goal of this research was to generate and test an innovative, cost effective antigen display and delivery system that uses micro particulate gas vesicles (GV). Although it has been long known that portions (epitopes) of molecules can be recognized by the immune system and the antibodies stimulated against the correct epitope(s) can elicit protective immunity, recently there has been significantly increased interest in the exploration of novel approaches to vaccine development and immunogen delivery. Thus growth of biotechnology and development of new tools now support the important expansion to include a diversity of new aspects that support moving beyond conventional immunization approaches and obtaining new information defining vaccine components [1][2][3].\n\nHalobacterium sp. NRC-1 is a remarkable organism that exhibits a number of characteristics that are significant to its biotechnology utility. Culturing is simple, DNA mediated transformation may be accomplished at high efficiency and proteins and organelles can be released from the halobacteria by simple lysis in hypotonic medium. The Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genome is completely sequenced [4] and the genomic data supports a wide range of studies that enhance its potential for commercial uses, as well as basic biochemical analyses of adaptation to extreme conditions. In addition, both an halobacterium transformation system [5,6] and E. coli/Halobacterium sp. shuttle plasmids, developed for basic genetic studies, are directly applicable to biotechnological applications. The cell envelope of Halobacterium salinarum consists of a single lipid bilayer membrane surrounded by an S-layer assembled from the cell-surface glycoprotein. This fact is important in terms of simple release of gas vesicles, or cytosolic proteins, from the organism. The gas vesicles themselves are unique organelles naturally produced by halophilic archaea and their biogenesis is inherently quality controlled by the organism. Fourteen gvp genes have been identified as encoding components involved in the genesis of organelles, and the regulation of gvp gene expression has been shown to occur at the transcriptional and translational levels [7][8][9][10].\n\nGas vesicle organelles are cylindrical-shaped particles with conical ends about 200 nm long, and composed of an inflexible, thin (20Å) proteinaceous (lipid free) membrane [11][12][13] that encloses a gas-filled space. The lipid free membranes form a barrier to liquids but are permeable to many dissolved gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and methane. The membrane has an extremely stable, two-dimensional crystalline lattice composed of two major proteins, GvpA and GvpC. The GvpA protein is highly conserved and forms a linear crystalline array of ribs that form the cylindrical shell and conical ends of the gas vesicle. GvpC is located on the vesicle outer surfaces and adds strength, stability and shape. Previous findings suggested that GvpC is present on the external surface of the vesicle and functions as a \"molecular glue\" to enhance the membrane stability [14]. With regard to peptide display, these characteristics are desirable in terms of antigen presentation and are potentially important for applications involving epitope display, a key for vaccine development. In this context, previous findings indicate there is no evidence of harmful effects from consuming native halobacteria [15,16] so that recombinant gas vesicles should be suitable for use in oral as well as parenteral delivery.\n\nElectron microscopy has demonstrated that the surface of the GV itself is highly organized suggesting it would support organized presentation of encoded antigen, and it is known that these stable protein structures themselves can provide an intrinsic adjuvant activity. Preliminary evidence demonstrated that gas vesicles can be genetically manipulated to display peptides coded by an insert of irrelevant DNA that specified a sequence of six amino acids, and peptide immunogenecity and antigenicity were verified both in vitro and in vivo [17,18]. Initial studies with the gag gene from SIVmac have raised the possible utility as a display/delivery system using gas vesicles to present pathogen peptide sequences up to 235 amino acids; these results also suggested the recombinant organelles were intrinsically self-adjuvanting [18,19]. Thus the preceding studies indicated the GvpC protein is sufficiently flexible to tolerate exogenous sequence inserts and thus support the principle of gas vesicles as a recombinant component for pathogen display/delivery. The studies presented below tested the generalized applicability of this technology using selected DNA segments encoding pathogen peptide sequences of diverse size and native gene function. These were assessed for plasmid retention of the exogenous DNA sequences, gas vesicle retention of the recombinant protein and the long term maintenance of elicited humoral responses to the exogenous peptide sequences displayed by the r-GvpC protein that had been incorporated into the organelle.\n\n\nResults\n\nOur earlier studies to generate recombinant gas vesicles provided evidence that when inserted into an appropriate site in the gvpC gene, this halobacterial gene would accept SIV gag gene DNA segments of different lengths and the resultant sub microscopic organelles would express this recombinant protein at the gas vesicle surface [19]. To demonstrate the potential flexibility and gene independent nature of surface expression using this cassette based system, we applied the methods outlined below and prepared a series of 21 different plasmids that encompassed the entire SIV genome. The three gene segments selected for detailed study were used to transform the Vacmutant Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, strain SD109 to obtain recombinant gas vesicles. After expanding the different initial transformant populations, the functional expression of the three fragments, each representing a different insert length and a different gene, was then tested through assessments of the gas vesicles produced. Functional (floating) recombinant gas vesicles were readily isolated from each of the transformants and then tested to detect recombinant GvpC expressing the SIV Tat, Rev or Nef1 encoded peptide and assessed for recognition as SIV genome derived using sera from an SHIV infected monkey. They then were used to immunize mice in order to test for their capacity to stimulate peptide specific humoral response in the absence of exogenous adjuvant and for the retention of titers for an extended time period.\n\n\nGeneration of DNA components\n\nThe 21 segments constituting the SIV genome were successfully amplified previously and for larger genes, e.g. Nef, the multiple fragments of the same gene were numbered numerically starting at the amino terminal end. Table 1 shows the PCR primers used to amplify the specific gene segments studied in detail here as well as the primers for the 350 bp internal segment amplified from the gvpC gene. The individual SIV gene segments were then expanded, using pUC19 and transformation of E. coli DH5α, followed by cloning into a second vector pFM101d shown in Figure 1. Following the steps outlined in the Methods section, the selected blunt end SIV fragments were then ligated into an Eco47 III site in the gvpC gene at the position designated as \"d\" in the rightward operon in the plasmid pFM101d and used for the transformation of E. coli. After expanding E. coli transformants, rightward operons with their SIV derived DNA insert were harvested from the plasmids using the Spe I and AsiS I. Each recombinant operon was then ligated into plasmid pMS104d using the methods described previously for pFM104d [19].\n\nIn order to confirm that these plasmids retained the inserted SIV DNA sequences, the DNA was isolated from each different transformant population, and from the wild type, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. Using the appropriate forward and reverse primer specific for the gvpC gene of each of the incorporated SIV derived DNA segments and shown in Table 1, the DNA was PCR amplified. As shown by the agarose gel in Figure 2, these amplification products indeed demonstrated the expected size relative to the 1 kb standard and to the Control (C), the internal 350 bp fragment from the native gvpC gene of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. The electrophoretic mobility of amplification products demonstrates successive increases in base pair (bp) sizes, fully consistent with the selected SIV genomic DNA inserts. As the amplicons of the DNA inserts demon-strate, each of the three different exogenous DNA sequences had been stably retained in the recombinant gvpC gene contained in the rightward gas vesicle operon.\n\n\nTransformation of Vac -Halobacterium strain SD109\n\nThe Vac -(minus) mutant, Halobacterium strain SD109 lacks the entire gas vesicle gene cluster and was used for Strategy for incorporating SIV DNA sequences into the gvpC gene carried in plasmid pFM101d Figure 1 Strategy for incorporating SIV DNA sequences into the gvpC gene carried in plasmid pFM101d. Plasmid pFM101d contains the rightward gas vesicles operon with the gvp genes (A, C and N). A unique Eco47 III site at location \"d\", within the gvpC gene, allowed insertion of the exogenous DNA fragments. The unique restriction enzyme sites Spe I, AsiS I and Afl II allowed manipulation/isolation of this cluster of gas vesicle genes by appropriate restriction digests. The antibiotic resistance genes are indicated with the boxes and allow selection of transformed E. coli or SD109 using Ampicilin (Amp) and Mevinolin (mev), respectively.  transformation following the protocols described in the Methods. Spheroplasts were prepared from the Vac -SD109 strain and can be readily distinguished from the normal rod shape of these halobacteria by microscopic examination ( Figure 3A and 3B). This fact supports simple and straightforward verification that the spheroplast form required for transformation of the Vacmutant has been achieved. The spheroplasts were then transformed using pMS104D::tat, ::rev or ::nef1 and methods described below. The putative SD109 transformants were cultured under mevinolin selection and could be readily assessed for gas vesicle production. As seen in the comparison of liquid cultures shown in Figure 4, Vacand Vac + cultures are readily distinguishable. Figure 4A shows the slightly cloudy appearance of a Vac -SD109 culture which appears brownish orange in color. In contrast, Figure 4B-C show the typical milky white culture appearance of the gas vesicle containing wild type Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 or successfully transformed SD109 strain. Similarly, visual inspections of transformants grown on plate media, shown in Figure 4D, also supports visual tracking for successful transformation to produce Vac + (plus) recombinants. Figure 4E shows examples of isolated r-GV and these clearly display the characteristic pink-tinged white band of gas vesicles at the interface of the 5% NaCl solution with the overlaying air; GV flotation at this interface verified that the recombinant GV are functional.\n\nThus the initial findings have been verified and extended to transformations using inserts of diverse DNA sizes and encoded gene function. This is a key step in r-GV production and the generation of functional product that can be readily harvested. The actual biosynthesis of the gas vesicle product and the retention of gas vesicle function, i.e. floatation of the isolated product, can be readily assessed visually. In combination, these findings demonstrate that the transformations with each of the selected recombinant plasmids (pMS104D::tat, ::rev and ::nef1) were successful and had conferred a functional, Vac + status to the recipient SD109 Vacmutants, irrespective of the insert selected for these studies, or its native function.\n\n\nIdentification of the recombinant GV proteins by Western blot\n\nIn our earlier studies the GvpC protein was clearly evident when anti-GvpC antiserum was used. Recombinant\n\nSpheroplast formation by the gas vesicle deficient strain SD109 results in a distinctive, spherical morphology \n\n\nA B\n\nVerification of SIV DNA sequence retention in the gvpC gene following plasmid amplification SIVsm-GvpC protein expressing sequences of the gag gene was identifiable using antiserum from SIVsm challenged monkeys and standard ELISA titration of gas vesicles containing chimeric SIVsm-GvpC Gag protein demonstrated the presence of recognizable SIV gag gene insert expressed by r-GvpC Gag [19]. To demonstrate that the expression of recombinant peptide originally examined using a gag sequence was not insert specific or unique, this study examined recombinant SD109 transformants expression of the three different SIV encoded peptides within the framework of recombinant GvpC protein. Gas vesicles were isolated from independent, replicate cultures of each of the different recombinant populations. These were analyzed by Western blot for the presence of recombinant GvpC protein exhibiting the anticipated increase in molecular weight and recognition by the specific anti-GvpC antibody. Although halobacterial proteins behave anomalously in analyses using the standard analytical technique of SDS-PAGE [20], nevertheless the approximate molecular weight (MW) can be assessed by adding the molecular weight of the SIV insert to apparent molecular weight previously demonstrated in this system. The results are shown in Table 2 and indicate that the SDS-PAGE technique should readily detect altered electrophoretic mobility reflecting insert associated size differences. Gas vesicles putatively expressing recombinant GvpC containing Tat, Rev or Nef1 peptides were isolated from the appropriately transformed SD109 cultures. Gas vesicles similarly isolated from wild type organisms, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, provided the molecular weight marker for the wild type GvpC protein used in the immuno-identifications. Using standard protocols for SDS-PAGE and then Western blots, all samples were transferred to Immobilon membranes and probed with appropriate antibodies to detect the proteins of interest.\n\nGvpC protein was identified by Western blot membrane incubation with anti-GvpC rabbit serum generated by immunizations using a lacZ-GvpC fusion protein and noted previously [14,19]. Gas vesicle preparations were isolated from populations transformed to incorporate Tat or Rev amino acid sequences. As Figure 5 demonstrates, the anti-GvpC antibody recognized GvpC contained in the putative fusion proteins. As this Western blot also indicates, characteristic differences in apparent molecular ‡ Predicted MW is based on results for GvpC from wild type GV (NRC-1) where the protein band was indicated at ~ 60 kDa [18]. Accordingly, the MW for the recombinant proteins was calculated as a sum of the specific insert and the MW for the GvpC. Isoelectric points were calculated using the Web page for pI/MW calculation [42].\n\nGrowth by SD109 transformants producing gas vesicles is visually distinguishable from the Vac -SD109 mutant Figure 4 Growth by SD109 transformants producing gas vesicles is visually distinguishable from the Vac -SD109 mutant. Panels A-E show typical cultures of wild type or transformed halobacteria. Panel A: the gas vesicle deficient (GV -) strain SD109 which in natural color exhibits a characteristic rust brown appearance; Panel B: a culture of the wild type gas vesicles (GV + ) from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, exhibits the characteristic milky appearance of GV + cultures. Panel C: a culture of transformed halobacteria strain SD109 expressing the nef1 encoded peptide exhibits the characteristic rounded morphology of GV + cultures when plated on agar media with the slightly pink tinged white coloration. Panels D and E: Isolated recombinant gas vesicles, like the native ones are evident as a white ring at the interface of the air/5% NaCl solution. Flotation of the r-GV to this interface verifies the chimeric GV isolated from SD109 transformed with pMS104D::tat or ::nef1 are functional. A comparison with the migration of native GvpC released from wild type gas vesicles in the lane labeled wt (NRC-1), a control included in Figure 6, shows the normal mobility of this wild type protein (Panel A). At the left side of Figure 6, Panel A shows the anti-GvpC antisera recognizes GvpC of wild type NRC-1 gas vesicles, while Panel B demonstrates that the anti-SHIV monkey sera does not recognize wild type GvpC. Panel C provides evidence that this same anti-SHIV monkey serum does recognize SIV encoded peptides within the recombinant GvpC protein (r-GvpC Tat , and r-GvpC Rev ). Thus, as expected based on Table 2, the Western blots have demonstrated the expected increased apparent molecular weight of the r-GvpC proteins. More importantly, the fact that anti-SHIV monkey serum fails to recognize wild type GvpC validates this plasma for specific detection of SIV peptide inserts.\n\nRecognition of the Nef1 peptide contained within the chimeric GvpC protein was similarly demonstrated. Panel A of Figure 7 shows a Coomassie blue stained SDS PAGE gel analysis for r-GvpC Nef1 presence in isolated recombinant gas vesicles or lysate of SD109 cells transformed with the pMS104D::nef1. Panel B of Figure 7 is a Western blot of these same samples and demonstrates that antisera from\n\nImmunoblots verify nef1 DNA also is expressed by r-GvpC Nef1 and carried by recombinant gas vesicles Figure 7 Immunoblots verify nef1 DNA also is expressed by r-GvpC Nef1 and carried by recombinant gas vesicles. SDS-PAGE and Western blots demonstrate that Nef1 also is successfully expressed and can be detected in lysates and r-GV of SD109 transformed with pMS104D::nef1. The Coomassie Blue stained 12% SDS-PAGE gels shows resolution of proteins in gas vesicles or lysates from these transformed SD109 cultures (Panel A). Duplicates of these resolved proteins were electroblotted (Panel B) and the presence of the Nef1 peptide in chimeric r-GvpC, identified by both absorbed anti-Nef1 sera from mice immunized with r-GV Nef1 and the monkey anti-SHIV antibody (plasma number R94085). Antibody binding shows recognition of Nef1 peptide within the recombinant GvpC protein. The mouse anti-Nef1 serum was used at a 1:250 dilution; the monkey anti-SHIV antibody was used at a 1:200 dilution. The standards (kDa) are shown on the left and the immuno detected band for recombinant Nef1 containing r-GvpC protein is identified on the right.  mice immunized with r-GV Nef1 and also monkey anti-SHIV sera each recognize the chimeric r-GvpC Nef1 protein.\n\nThus the results demonstrate the Nef1 peptide sequence is expressed and retained by the recombinant gas vesicles used in murine immunizations. Equally important, recognition by the anti-SHIV monkey serum demonstrates that like chimeric Tat and Rev peptide containing GvpC proteins, the Nef1 chimeric protein is also perceived as containing the SIV derived peptide.\n\n\nELISA Assessments\n\nTo verify the immunogenecity of these recombinant gas vesicles and test the critical parameter, presence of the humoral immune response, mice were immunized with recombinant gas vesicles and their antibody responses to the SIV derived inserts assessed. Immunizations followed the methods and injection schedule outlined in the Methods and used isolated r-GV Tat, Rev or Nef1 , gas vesicles produced by mutant halobacteria SD109 transformed with the plasmids pMS104D-SIV::tat, ::rev, or ::nef1. The serum samples drawn at various post-immunization time points were assayed by ELISA. Sera samples, fully pre-adsorbed with wt-GV as described in the Methods, were assayed to detect SIV insert specific antibody recognition by using r-GV produced by the homologous transformants and the average absorbances at 405 nm were graphed. Figure 8 presents these results in the separate three dimensional data displays and these show the sera titers at the different times during the course of immunizations. Inherently these humoral responses demonstrate the immunogenecity of each of the incorporated SIV peptides displayed by these three different r-GV. Each r-GV elicits a solid peptide specific antibody response to the initial low dose, demonstrates a secondary response to the booster and a natural waning of antibody titer over time, as shown by assay of the 12 week post booster sera. In addition, the development of an immune response inherently demonstrates both the presence of the displayed r-GvpC protein and, because the sera were fully pre-adsorbed, the immune system \"visibility\" of the specific SIV inserts. The titration data also hint that differences in the responses to the different inserts might not be closely linked to the actual size of SIV encoded peptide; the responses to the Tat insert (50 amino acids) was clearly more robust than the response to the Rev insert (81 amino acids). This might provide a simple and useful method to screen peptide segments that could provide an index of inherent capacity to elicit humoral responses, although additional studies would be required to demonstrate and verify ELISA based detection of inherent immunogenicity.\n\nFeatures critical to immunization based protection also include the continued presence of elevated antigen specific antibody and the occurrence of such responses, independent of the specific peptide tested. Figure 9 presents ELISA titration data showing the antibody levels remaining 43 weeks after a re-immunizing booster with the homologous r-Gv. For the group immunized with r-GV Rev only one animal remained at this very late time point; its serum titered at ~1:160. For the animals in the groups immunized with r-GV Tat or r-GV Nef1 , very substantial insert specific antibody titers (~1:1280 and 1:640) remained at the 43 week time point. This finding supports the conclusion that the humoral response to diverse peptides expressed using the r-GV display/delivery system can remain notably elevated. Potentially this would result from a slow release of proteins from the gas vesicle as it is degraded intracellularly and in vitro studies indicate this is the case (manuscript in preparation). The system therefore exhibits a characteristic desirable in an immunizing agent. In addition, the absence of exogenous adjuvant in this system provides additional evidence of the self adjuvanting characteristic of the recombinant gas vesicle delivery vehicle.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn a previous study we demonstrated immunologic memory for the peptide expressed by r-GV was elicited, however the assessments of r-GV in that study involved only the expression of peptide sequences from a single SIV gag gene [19]. The ELISA data presented here tested quite different peptide sequences incorporated into the r-GvpC protein and the results indicate that in this context, these too are stimulatory and immune visible. The results presented above extend and strengthen the initial hypothesis that r-GV can serve as a flexible cassette based epitope display/delivery system that supports expression of genes or gene segments encoding peptides from proteins representing diverse functions in their native context. Here we tested peptides encoded by three different SIVsm genes. The Tat protein can function indirectly to promote virus replication via receptor mediated signal transduction, while intracellularly Tat normally is transported into the host cell nucleus. The protein is essential for viral replication and is currently a candidate vaccine component. Rev functions as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein normally found primarily in host cell nuclei/nucleoli. One of its functions is to \"escort\" unspliced viral mRNA out of the nucleus. In contrast, Nef is a peripheral membrane protein, and appears to have a linker function, among others. Thus Nef mediates a variety of protein-protein interactions via its SH3 binding surface and down regulates MHC class I, and CD4 expression, perhaps through its capacity as a linker. Nef therefore can exert significant effects on the host cell functions [21][22][23][24][25][26][27]. From the data presented here, clearly the DNA segments tested, representing sequences from proteins with significant inherent functional differences, were stably incorporated into the gvpC gene. The data also shows the insert peptide is retained in the recombinant GvpC protein, and the chimeric proteins produced are effectively incorporated to produce recombinant gas vesicles. For all three test peptide sequences the functionality of the r-GvpC was shown by the generation of gas vesicles that float, and r-GvpC release from isolated gas vesicles during sample preparation for SDS-PAGE, verifies r-GvpC were incorporation as part of the organelles themselves. Likewise, immunogenicity was demonstrated through the anti-peptide responses elicited. These demonstrated r-GV effectiveness as a delivery vehicle and support the conclusion that irrespective of the gene source, the displayed peptides are immune system visible and immunostimulatory. The known structure of GV microparticles and their resistance to degradation, support the suggestion that these functional characteristics of this unusual display system are keys to their effectiveness as an adjuvant.\n\nThe basis of this self adjuvanting effect remains to be clarified but characteristics of certain halobacterial proteins may be relevant. Molecular chaperones are essential components of organisms that function as part of the normal physiology, and in response to stress, and pathology. A molecular chaperone system also is present in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and represented by the proteins DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and Hsps1-4 (small heat shock proteins). The peptide-binding function of Hsp's (heat shock proteins) allows chaperon proteins such as Hsp70 (heatshock protein 70) to acquire antigenic proteins within cells, even when administered outside the cell and thereby induce priming of CD8 + T lymphocytes in vivo. In addition to peptide binding and delivery, Hsp70 also can assist as a carrier of peptides or proteins that are effective immunogens for B cells, CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells, in the absence of Immunogen specific ELISA titrations of antibody elicited by rGV Tat, Rev or Nef1 encoded sequences an adjuvant. Thus it has been shown that the C-terminal portion of Hsp70 (amino acids 359-610) induces human monocytes to produce CC chemokines (chemotactic cytokines), IL-12 (interleukin-12), TNF a (tumour necrosis factor alpha), as well as stimulating the maturation of dendritic cells [28]. Additionally there is evidence that for microbial Hsp, this C-terminal portion of Hsp70 is involved as an adjuvant in the induction of the innate and adaptive elements of the immune response [29].\n\nThe slow degradation of wt-and r-GV could readily initiate Hsps up-regulation in the host cell. Therefore, the selfadjuvanting characteristics of gas vesicles could be analogous to the chaperon activities of Hsp 70, produced by the host cells in response to perturbation by the gas vesicle presence, and in fact there is a notable similarity between the GvpC protein and the DnaK and DnaJ proteins. In addition, or alternatively, the geometric display on gas vesicle surfaces may be analogous to the display achieved when bacterial S-layers are used. Such displays are known to enhance immune responses [30].\n\nInherent features of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and their biosynthesis of gas vesicles are highly relevant to biotechnological utilities and these are evident here, in the steps to generate and test the recombinant organelles. The plasmid pFM101d allows simple insertion of exogenous DNA cassettes and subsequent transfer into the Halobacterium strain SD109 transformation vector. A simple restriction digest cleavage of the rightward operon is followed by ligation into pMS104d, the large (18.9 kb) plasmid used to transfer the 14 genes needed for gas vesicle biogenesis. As application of simple agarose gel analysis showed, successful SD109 transformation can be readily assessed via EtBr (Ethidium Bromide) staining to verify amplification products with the appropriate bp sizes. The actual transformation of plasmid recipient is readily achieved by a one step treatment of the Vac -SD109 strain with spheroplasting solution. A cell wall, such as is characteristic of gram positive or gram negative bacteria is not present in these archaeal organisms. This fact simplifies transformation as well as the subsequent gas vesicle isolation processes. Further, spheroplast formation itself can be verified by simple microscopic examination of the treated halobacterial samples. The SD109 cells undergo a shape change and exhibit a spherical rather than the normal rod morphology (Figure 3). Such spheroplasts were readily transformed without additional treatments by simple incubation with isolated pMS104D::tat ::rev:: or :: nef1 DNA. Similarly, successful transformation and appropriate function of the genes transferred by the transforming plasmid is also easily determined. For liquid media, the formation of \"creamy-white\" halobacterial cultures vs. the rust brown of Vac -SD109 cultures is diagnostic for gas vesicle production and readily evident by simple visual inspection as seen in Figure 4.\n\nThe specific verifications provided here are keys in the context of validating this system and the peptides tested. First, as clearly shown, recombinant GvpC expressed by the vesicles demonstrate an expected decrease in electrophoretic mobility vis-à-vis GvpC from gas vesicles produced by wild type Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. Second, in the present study, the gene segments inserted into the gvpC encode peptides from proteins exemplifying a variety of functions, and as Figures 5, 6, 7 showed, when displayed by r-GvpC, each one was recognized not only by anti-GvpC antibody ( Figure 5), validating retention of the r-GvpC protein, but also by antibody elicited in vivo during infection of monkeys with SHIV virus (Figures 6, 7). Since the anti-SHIV antibody did not recognize wild type GV protein ( Figure 6B), the incorporated SIV peptides were being specifically identified when displayed as part of the r-GvpC protein which is present at sites all over the gas vesicle surface. Thus the insert into the GvpC protein is both immune system visible and accessible. Equally important, display of the SIV peptides in this manner did not abrogate their recognition by appropriate antisera. Finally, it is also highly relevant that as the titration of sera collected 43 weeks post re-immunization shows, titers remained for all three peptides although at 1:160, the anti-Rev titer was the lowest of the three. However, the titer for Rev likely reflects the fact that only one animal in this group was extant. At this very late time point the titers r-GV immunizations elicit long lived antibody responses to the displayed SIV specific peptide inserts of the animals immunized with Nef1 and Tat r-GV (~1:640 and 1,280) were very notably higher.\n\nFrom the perspective of general utility and ease of recombinant production, the characteristic inherent in the system used here and the effective incorporation of exogenous pathogen DNA sequences, both were demonstrated in the course of generating the recombinant gas vesicles. The features critical to their unusual utility include characteristics inherent to the gas vesicle organelle itself as well as the Halobacteria sp. in which they form.\n\nThey are relevant to r-GV use in biotechnology applications such as a pathogen peptide display and/or delivery system. Thus, despite the unusual intracellular environment that halophiles maintain, and the unusual nature of their native proteins [31,32], the pathogen gene sequences were retained and also translated with fidelity in the halobacteria SD109 expression system as demonstrated by SHIV antibody recognition. The recombinant GvpC proteins themselves are incorporated into the gas vesicle structures as demonstrated by r-GvpC release from isolated organelles and recognition by both anti-GvpC and anti-SHIV antibody. Inherently, the GvpC protein, as the \"molecular glue\" for the organelle, is present at the surface of recombinant gas vesicles [12]. In addition, as previously published electron micrograph show, this surface intrinsically exhibits a highly organized, patterned surface [7,18]. Finally, gas vesicle formation itself is quality controlled by the gvp gene cluster carried by the transformed SD109 strain and release of the organelles themselves is easily achieved by simply suspending the halobacteria in water with 1.0 mM MgSO 4 .\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe studies presented here clearly demonstrate that recombinant GvpC proteins displaying peptides encoded by sequences from the three very different SIV genes each are expressed, the translated proteins are incorporated into the recombinant organelles and like native GvpC, the recombinant proteins in turn are appropriately integrated to produce functional organelles. The different chimeric r-GvpC are detected in isolated gas vesicle preparations and therefore the relevant incorporated gene sequences have been retained by transformed SD109, and the r-GvpC proteins themselves, are retained by the r-GV. The ELISA data demonstrate the r-GV, with their highly ordered surfaces serve as an effective display platform for peptide sequences as an integral part of the r-GV surface structure. Further, as shown by the ELISA data for serum samples collected at 43 weeks post re-immunization, notably elevated titers remained (Figures 8 and 9). From a practical perspective it is also relevant that the recombinant organelles also retain the natural gas vesicle functionality since they clearly float to the air/5% NaCl interface. Thus, like the wild type organelles, following halobacteria lysis by transfer to hypotonic medium r-GV can be readily isolated by centrifuge assisted flotation. Finally, from a production standpoint, it is also significant that because a standard bacterial cell wall is not present, the recombinant SD109, like the wild type Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, require a high salt environment (≥ 5 M NaCl) to maintain organism integrity. In the absence of high salt, the halobacteria lyse and therefore for this recombinant, display system, \"escape\" of viable halobacteria cannot occur. In addition as sub-cellular organelles the r-GV, unlike the various permutations of bacterial ghosts [33,34], contain only a very limited number of \"foreign\" proteins. Therefore in this they differ significantly from the complex array of protein and carbohydrate inherently present in the bacterial ghost based delivery systems. Taken together, from the perspective of cost and recombinant containment, and extended retention of elevated humoral immune response elicited, the submicroscopic particles that constitute the halobacterial gas vesicle system have the potential to provide an alternative antigen display and delivery system. The ease of tailoring specific epitope presentations inherent in the surface display of peptides by the organelle would also support use of this system for displays to screen for humoral responses to specific pathogen epitopes, or as the peptide component in prime and boost immunizations [35,36].\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nPlasmid design\n\nPlasmid pFM101d (DasSarma and Morshed, unpublished data [5,37]) carries the rightward gas vesicle operon and a unique site for insertions within gvpC gene that restriction enzyme Eco47 III cleaves ( Figure 1); it was used in generating the three recombinant gvpC genes studied here. The shuttle vector containing origins of replication for E. coli and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, and selectable drug resistance markers, as well as genes for gas vesicles (GV) synthesis [14,7] was re-constructed using plasmids pSP104, pFM101d and pFM104::gag 504. Like pFM104d [19] this plasmid, termed vector pMS104d contains Eco47 III restriction site at the \"d\" location and all the genes necessary for gas vesicle synthesis. It was used in the present studies to generate the three different transformants populations each of which incorporated one of gene segments of interest, tat (150 bp), rev (243 bp) and nef1 (642 bp).\n\n\nAmplification of SIVsm DNA and Preparation of Plasmids PCR amplification of the SIV genomic fragments\n\nGenomic sooty mangabey monkey (SIVsmm) template DNA, a gift from Dr. V. Hirsch from NIH, was PCR amplified using standard recombinant technology methods [38]. Briefly, based on the published SIVsmm proviral genome sequence [GenBank: X14307], the primers necessary to amplify the entire genome as 21 individual fragments were designed, then synthesized commercially (Sigma-GenoSys, Woodlands TX). To restrict DNA segment sizes ≤ 650 bp, as necessary, genes were cleaved into segments and numbered accordingly. The forward and reverse primers for the fragments encoding SIV tat, rev and nef1 assessed in detail here, the relevant primers for gvpC amplification and the amplified DNA fragment sizes are shown in Table 1.\n\nFor each amplification, the 100 μl reaction mixture contained the following: 10 \n\n\nPlasmid Preparation and Amplifications\n\nAs described in detail previously [19], the generation of transformed Vac -(minus) halobacterial SD109 mutants used a series of plasmids. The initial PCR products provided SIV fragments and following phosphorylation, the selected SIV fragments and the pUC19 vector (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA), cleaved with Sma I, were dephosphorylated using Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP, Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis IN). Fragments were gel purified and separately ligated with T4 ligase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc; Piscataway, NJ). E. coli cells (DH5α) were rendered competent using the standard treatment with calcium chloride as detailed previously [38,14], then transformed and the incorporated SIV DNA amplified. Each SIV containing insert was subsequently removed by digesting the isolated plasmid with Sma I. Vector pFM101d was cut with Eco47 III, dephosphorylated using SAP, gel purified and subsequently the SIV inserts were blunt-end ligated into the Eco47 III site of the gvpC gene contained in the plasmid pFM101d shown in Figure 1. Aliquots of competent DH5α cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were then transformed with plasmids termed pFM101D::tat,::rev, and ::nef1 and grown in Luria broth (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA), containing 20 mM glucose and 100 μg/ml Ampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), the selectable marker for amplification in E. coli. Using the published DNA sequences for gvpC and for each SIV fragment, plasmid DNA was assessed by PCR amplification to verify the presence of SIV tat, rev or nef1 insertion using a gvpC forward primer and the reverse primers for the respective tat, rev or nef1 gene segments (Table 1). All plasmid constructs were routinely characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and after confirmation that the plasmid DNA included gvpC containing the appropriate insert and orientation; they were excised from pFM101D using Spe I and AsiS I ( Figure  1). Following gel purification, the fragment with the rightward operon containing the tat, rev or nef1 insert was ligated into pMS104d, also cut with Spe I and AsiS I. The resultant insert containing plasmids, pMS104D::tat, ::rev and ::nef1 were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and/or PCR analysis, then the plasmid construct with its SIV DNA cassette insert was sequenced using an ABI sequencer to verify the SIVsm inserts to confirm that no deletions or mutations had occurred. Like pFM104d [19], this plasmid, pMS104d is 18.9 Kb in size and contains the origin of replication for halobacteria and the selectable marker, mevinolin.  [6] and are described in detail in the Archaea: A Laboratory Manual, Protocol 29 and Appendix 2 [39]. Colonies were scored visually for the gas vesicle phenotype (Vac + ) and Vac + colonies expanded (Figure 4), using high salt peptone (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) with 10 μg/ml mevinolin as described previously to select for the recombinants [18,19].\n\n\nExpansion of SD109 Transformant populations and gas vesicle isolation\n\nTransformant populations were expanded using growth at 37°C on agar plates containing added trace metals (ZnSO 4 , MnSO 4 , CuSO 4 and FeSO 4 ) and the selective antibiotic, mevinolin (CM+Mev+). Several colonies were then selected from each transformation and grown in liquid media under the same selective conditions. The retention of the inserted SIV DNA fragments was verified by restriction analysis and validated transformant cultures were grown at 37°C using larger plates to produce recombinant populations from which gas vesicles would be harvested. Gas vesicles from these transformed SD109 were harvested by cell lysis using water containing 1.0 mM magnesium sulfate and subsequently subjected to 3-5 rounds of centrifugally assisted flotation to isolate the organelles from cell debris as described previously [18,19]. Gas vesicle yields were first assessed spectrophotometrically (OD 596 ) and then precise concentrations were determined using the Biorad protein assay (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Isolated gas vesicles were stored in 5% NaCl at 4°C.  [40]. These virus specific sera were diluted 1:150 or 1:200 respectively using 1% BSA/PBS; mouse anti-Nef1 sera were used at a 1:250 dilution. Following 1.5-2 h incubation with anti-sera (SIV or SHIV), membranes were rinsed three times in 1% BSA/PBS. Specifically bound antibody was detected by incubation with either alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) chain (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) or with alkaline phosphatase conjugated rabbit anti-monkey antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Each conjugate was diluted 1:1,000 in 1% BSA/PBS and incubation continued for 1 hour. Membranes were rinsed three times with 1% BSA/PBS and two times with dH 2 O, then incubated with the alkaline phosphatase membrane substrate, SigmaFast (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO); protein bands developed within 5 min of substrate addition. Subsequently blots were rinsed in distilled water; air dried at RT and archived as scanned images.\n\n\nGas Vesicle Analyses\n\n\nSDS-PAGE\n\n\nAntigen preparation and immunizations\n\nMouse anti-SIV sera raised against protein encoded by SIV DNA insert sequences was generated by immunizing BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) with subcutaneous injections of recombinant GV in sterile PBS as outlined in the IACUC protocol specifically approved for these studies. Sera from immunizations with the expressed SIV inserts of Tat, Rev or Nef1 derived from gene segments inserted into the gvpC gene. Sera were collected from mice by tail bleed and the pre-bleed sera from these same mice were pooled and used as a matched control serum.\n\nBriefly, to test immunogenecity, 4 month-old mice were each injected subcutaneously at multiple sites on the upper back initially using low dose immunization (1-3 μg total protein) with recombinant gas vesicles (r-GV Tat, Rev, or Nef1 ) in 200 μl sterile PBS. The boosters used 50 μg total proteins per mouse; delivered in the same manner [41]. Sera were collected by tail bleed 2 and 4 weeks after primary immunization and at 4 weeks following the first booster. After the second booster, sera were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 17 weeks. Seventeen weeks after the 2 nd booster the mice were re-immunized using the same protein concentration and sera were collected 10 days later. The animals were then retained for a total of 43 weeks post-re-immunization and their sera were collected at that final time point. Sera were subsequently adsorbed and assayed by ELISA as described below.\n\n\nAdsorption of immune sera and ELISA assays\n\nPrior to ELISA antibody titration assays, immune sera were adsorbed to remove any antibody directed against the surface exposed wt-GvpC protein by incubations with wt-GV. After serum adsorptions, the gas vesicles were removed by 14,000 RPM centrifugation at room temperature (RT) which collapses the organelles, and the overly-ing serum was aspirated. Removal of anti-GV antibody was verified by standard ELISA using wt-GV as antigen. The test antigen used deflated (collapsed) gas vesicles prepared as follows. Isolated gas vesicles produced by wt-NRC1 or SD109 transformants were separately isolated, then deflated by brief micro centrifuge centrifugation; this drives the gas from the organelles yet retains the gas vesicle intact. Deflated gas vesicles were diluted to 1 μg per 100 μl in PBS, (pH 7.2) and served as the specific SIV Tat, Rev or Nef1 peptide antigen. ELISA wells (Immobilon, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) were filled with 100 μl of the appropriate wt-or r-GV Tat, Rev, or Nef1 /PBS solution, and then incubated for 1 hr at RT. After three rinses with PBS, wells were blocked for 1 hr at RT with 200 μl per well of 3% BSA/PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Wells were again rinsed with 200 μl PBS. Adsorbed immune mouse sera or pre-bleed sera were serially diluted in 0.1% BSA/ PBS. Wells were filled with 100 μl of diluted sera and incubated for 1 hr at RT, then rinsed 4 times with 200 μl of 0.1% BSA/PBS. Bound mouse immunoglobulin was detected using alkaline phosphatase conjugated affinity purified goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA), diluted 1:1,000 in 0.1% BSA/ PBS; 100 μl was added to each well. Following 1 hr incubation at RT, wells were rinsed five times with 0.1% BSA/ PBS then each well received 100 μl of pNPP substrate. The pH 9.8 substrate contained distilled water with 10% diethanolamine, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , as a stabilizer (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and 1 mg/ml of Sigma 104 paranitrophenylphosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Following an incubation of 60 or 90 min at 37°C, the absorbance at 405 nm was quantified using a VersaMax ELISA Reader (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA). All samples were assayed in triplicate.\n\nFigure 3\n3Spheroplast formation by the gas vesicle deficient strain SD109 results in a distinctive, spherical morphology. With the addition of spheroplasting solution and 0.5 M EDTA, the rod shape halobacteria cells (Panel A) rapidly changes into the transformable spheroplast form (Panel B) exhibiting a characteristic change in morphology detectible microscopically. Spheroplasts can then be transformed with the recombinant plasmids pMS104D::tat,::rev or ::nef1 carrying the native leftward operon of the gas vesicle gene cluster and the rightward operon carrying an inserted SIV fragment of interest. Original magnifications 1,000 ×.\n\nFigure 2\n2Verification of SIV DNA sequence retention in the gvpC gene following plasmid amplification. Following expansion of the pFM101D-SIV tat, rev and nef1 plasmid populations, DNA was tested for retention of the SIV specific insert carried by the recombinant gvpC genes. The agarose gel shows the PCR amplicon sizes of the selected SIV gene fragments and are indicated along the horizontal axis: tat:150, rev:243 and nef1:642 bp. Their presence inherently verifies SIV DNA retention by each r-gvpC genes. The Control (C) is an internal fragment from the gvpC gene and serves as a marker for the migration of this 350 bp fragment. The relevant primers are shown inTable 1.\n\n\nevident for the recombinant bands recognized by the anti-GvpC antibody. These differences allow discrimination from the wild type GvpC protein (see inFigure 6, Panel A), and are consistent with an expected differentially increased molecular weight of the recom-binant GvpC proteins produced by the transformants. The differences also are consistent with the anomalous behaviour of halobacterial gas vesicle proteins when analyzed by SDS-PAGE gels.\n\n\nVerification of recombinant GvpC protein formation and incorporation into functional gas vesiclesFigure 5 Verification of recombinant GvpC protein formation and incorporation into functional gas vesicles. Western blots were used to assess putative recombinant gas vesicles (Panel A) and cell lysates (Panel B) for the presence of r-GvpC protein. Here samples are resolved in 8-16% SDS-PAGE gels, immunoblotted and probed with rabbit anti-GvpC antibody. The size range of the protein standards (kDa) is indicated at the left and the recombinant GvpC protein bands are identified at the right.\n\n\nVerification that recombinant gas vesicles have GvpC pro-teins containing both halobacterial and SIV encoded peptidesFigure 6Verification that recombinant gas vesicles have GvpC proteins containing both halobacterial and SIV encoded peptides. Western blots of putative recombinant gas vesicle samples from cultures of SD109 transformed with pMS104D::tat or ::rev demonstrate the presence of chimeric GvpC proteins. Electroblotted wild type gas vesicles samples (wt-GV) prepared from the NRC-1 were incubated with purified rabbit anti-GvpC antibody or with monkey anti-SHIV antibody. As shown, the GvpC protein is clearly detected by anti-GvpC antibody (Panel A), but this protein is not detected by anti-SHIV antibody (Panel B). In cell lysates, Tat and Rev sequences contained in the putative recombinant GvpC protein are each detected using anti-SHIV antibody (plasma number R94085) from a monkey infected in vivo with SHIV virus (Panel C). The recombinant chimeric protein bands identified here correspond in size to bands identified with anti-GvpC antibody (seeFigure 5Panel B).\n\nFigure 8\n8Immunogen specific ELISA titrations of antibody elicited by rGV Tat, Rev or Nef1 encoded sequences. Mice were initially immunized using isolated r-GV and subsequently boosted as specified in the Methods. The three dimensional graphs display the temporal profiles of antigen specific antibody responses to the SIV peptide expressed within the GvpC protein. For Tat, all post-4 week samples exhibit a titer of ≥ 1:1,280 while for Rev, the maximal titer, 1:320 occurs in the week 2 post second booster sera. For Nef1, the highest titer, 1:320, is evident in sera from week 8 post second booster and by the 12 week time point, only sera from the animals immunized with r-GV expressing Rev retained a peptide specific titer.\n\nFigure 9 r\n9-GV immunizations elicit long lived antibody responses to the displayed SIV specific peptide inserts. Seventeen weeks after the second booster, mice were boosted again with homologous r-GV and then retained for 43 weeks. ELISA assessments of sera taken at week 43 demonstrate that notable titers remain at this very late time point: 1:160 for Rev; and for Tat and Nef1, the titers are ≥ 1:1,280. Note: for this graph the absorbance scale is 0.0 -5.0 and note also that (*) indicates only one animal remained in the Rev group at 43 weeks.\n\nTable 1 :\n1Primers sequences for PCR amplification of DNA encoding the proteins examined here.Fragments Primers \nSequence (5' to 3') \nSize (bp) \n\nTat \nTat F \nggg atg gag aca ccc ttg aag \n150 \nTat R \nggg atg ata gca aca cct ctt \nRev \nRev F \nggg tca gca gat ccc tat cca \n243 \nRev R \nggg cgg act ctt tgc aac gtc \nNef1 \nNef1 F \nggg atg ggt ggc gct att tcc \n642 \nNef1 R \nggg ctt cca tgc cag tac ctc \ngvpC \ngvpC F \nctc ctg ctg tga ttc tgc ga \n1,070 \ngvpC R \ncat cct cac cgt act cgt cg \ngvpC -Kpn I cta tgg cca cga gat cac g \n350 \n\nDNA sequences required to generate recombinant GvpC and \ndemonstrate the successful insertion and retention of test SIV DNA \nsequences utilized PCR amplification and the forward (F) and \nreverse(R) primers listed above. \n\n\nTable 2 :\n2Molecular Weight and pI for the proteins examined here.Characteristics \nGvpC \nTat \nRev \nNef1 \n\npI \n3.73 \n4.92 \n8.17 \n5.31 \npI (Fusion proteins) \n3.83 \n3.88 \n4.07 \nMW (Da) \n42,392 \n5,743 \n9,313 \n24,733 \nExpected MW  † \n48,117 \n51,687 \n67,106 \nPredicted MW  ‡ \n60,000 \n65,743 \n69,313 \n84,733 \n\n † Expected MW is calculated as GvpC + SIV insert; Tat, Rev and Nef1 \nrespectively. \n \n\n\nRestriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), DNA polymerase from Promega (Madison, WI) and T4 DNA ligase was included in the SureClone™ Ligation Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc; Piscataway, NJ); each component was used as specified by the manufacturer. For final validation, cloned DNA or PCR amplified SIV fragments were sequenced using an ABI 377XL automated DNA sequencer at the Sequencing Facility at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst or an ABI 3730 sequencer at the Microbiology Department, in conjunction with the ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator v.3.1 cycle sequencing kit. Following sequence confirmation, the derived SIV sequence containing plasmids, pMS104D::tat,:: rev and ::nef1 were used to transform the Vac -(minus) halobacterial strain SD109. and transformation of gas vesicle deficient Halobacterium sp. strain SD109 SD109, a mutant strain of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 lacking the gas vesicle gene cluster, is deficient in gas vesicle formation. Using a modified protocol for transformation of Halobacterium sp., recombinant plasmids each with one of the SIVsm gene segment, were transformed into the Vac -SD109. The methods used here are those optimized for Halobacterium salinariumGrowth \n\n\nAliquots of isolated wt-GV and recombinant gas vesicles (r-GV Tat, Rev, or Nef1 ), dialyzed against distilled water, were mixed with 5xSDS-PAGE sample buffer (Pierce-Endrogen, Rockford, IL), and heated 5 min in a boiling water bath. Then, 20-25 μl were loaded into wells of Novex pre-cast 8-16% or 12% gradient gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and electrophoresed until the tracking dye reached the bottom of the gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R250 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or electroblotted for Western analysis. MultiMark standards (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and SeeBlue PreStained Standards (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used to assess the molecular weight (MW) of protein species. blot For Western blots, proteins were transferred from the SDS-PAGE gel to Immobilon-P NC membrane or PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a BioRad transfer apparatus (BioRad, Hercules, PA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (NFDM) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2). This and all other incubations were carried out at RT on an orbital shaker. After blocking for 2.5 h, membranes were rinsed three times with 1% BSA/PBS, and then probed by incubation with immune serum, or the appropriate control serum. GvpC protein was detected using 0.020 μg/μl rabbit anti-GvpC antibody diluted in 1% BSA/PBS. SIV peptides expressed as part of the recombinant gas vesicle r-GvpC protein were identified with monkey anti-SIV sera (RHE 544, a gift from Dr. V. Hirsh, NIH).

However, little is known about the potential influence of ICT use, perceptions of health workers on ICT in healthcare delivery, and contribution of ICT to health care providers' retention in rural and remote areas in rural post-war and conflict situations of northern Uganda. Methods: Data from interviews were transcribed, coded and thematically analysed.Results: Participants generally exhibited low confidence, knowledge and low ICT skills. Majority of participants, however, perceived ICT as beneficial in relation to job performance and health care provider retention in rural areas. Common barriers for the implementation and use of ICT in health centres were inadequate ICT knowledge and skills, poor Internet networks, inadequate computers, inadequate power supply, lack of Internet Modems and expensive access to outside computer centres. Conclusions: This qualitative study showed low confidence, poor knowledge and skills in ICT usage but positive perceptions about the benefits and contributions of ICT. These findings suggest the need for specific investment in ICT infrastructural development for health care providers in remote rural areas of northern Uganda.\n\nBackground\n\nInformation and communication technologies (ICTs) have become a vital infrastructural asset for potential use in the retention of health care providers in remote rural areas [1][2][3][4][5]. Though there have been substantial studies on other factors that influence retention of health workers in rural areas such as pay rise, good housing and others [6], little attention has been put to explore the influence of ICT use on retention of health workers in rural and remote areas [3,5]. Just as the case in favour of ICT use in promoting the retention of health care providers in rural areas has been made, it is also reasonable to explore the perceptions of health workers on whether ICT facilities and infrastructural development might contribute to retention in rural post-war conflict northern Uganda. ICTs in this study can be defined as tools that facilitate communication, processing and transmission of information by electronic means [7].\n\nUse of information and communication technology is suggested to help break the isolation experienced by rural health workers [8,9] and it is suggested that health workers are responding to this challenge by adopting e-Health innovation [5]. Benefits of ICT such as online clarification of doubt, opportunity to transmit information, access to training, support to various forms and aspects of decision-making, increased access to specialised tools and access to information may have positive influence on health workers retention in rural and remote areas [3][4][5]. Reports indicate that specific ICT interventions such as eReferral, teleconsultation, electronic medical record and use of mobile phones have significant benefits to health workers in rural and remote areas [5,[9][10][11][12].\n\nStudies however provide us with no definitive understanding of whether the use of ICT and its availability directly influence retention of health workers. Available studies on ICT in health in rural and remote areas have emphasised mainly the benefits of ICT in work processes with little attention to the contributions that ICT might make on the retention of health workers. Bahttacharya and Ramachandran [13] have suggested that ICT is among the factors that can reasonably influence health workers' intention to stay in urban health facilities in India. Further, training and explaining the benefits of ICT to health workers may also improve retention. However few studies have been done on ICT in health in rural post-conflict situations [5] even though we need more knowledge on other strategies which may influence retention of health workers in underserved areas [3] that are emerging from protracted armed conflict. The post-war conflict situation in this study refers to the situation that followed the devastating and destructive effects of armed conflict in northern Uganda between the Government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), which began in 1986 and ended with the June 2006 peace negotiation [14]. After the war, government priority has been on the reconstruction of what was destroyed and recruiting more health workers to serve in rural post-war conflict northern Uganda. Though these efforts are continuously being implemented, attracting and retaining skilled health workers in rural areas in Uganda still remains elusive. Data on retention of health professionals in Uganda is reported as inadequate; however some of the top strategies that are thought to support retention are: providing accommodation, providing salary top-up for health care providers willing to work in hard-to-reach areas, improving the style of supervision and management, education and training opportunities for health workers, improving work conditions, providing social needs support, and health and access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) [2,3,6,[15][16][17][18]. Despite all these strategies having been tried, significant shortage of health professionals still remains a big challenge [19,20], especially having trained health professionals retained in remote rural areas [21,22]. Within the decentralized healthcare system of Uganda, each of the districts has a well established system of health facilities from level five (district hospitals) at the district headquarters to level one at the village level. Qualified general duty medical officers serve at levels five and four; levels four, three and two being in remote rural areas of each district with little access to social amenities including recreational centres, schools and good road infrastructures. Under the circumstance, health care providers in rural Uganda feel isolated and lack access to peer-support. ICT facilities at these centres may also be rudimentary and may not be functional. Attrition rates from some of the duty stations are often high [23]. Reports in Uganda indicates that only 55%, 45% and 33% posts were filled in HC IV, HC III and HC II in the financial year 2009/2010 respectively resulting in inequitable distribution of health care workers [24,25].\n\nIn Uganda, the unprecedented shortage of health care providers is also attributed to high attrition, low morale and lack of promotional opportunity for health workers. Many times, effectiveness of retention strategies for health professionals is not evaluated and their implementation is done without considering the needs, preferences and perceptions of health professionals themselves [26]. Much as other retention strategies for health professionals have been reported, they do not meet all the requirements for complete attraction and retention [6] and many have yielded little success [27]. The aim of this study was to explore other retention strategies with the potential to enhance retention of health professionals in rural and remote areas. The study explored the perceptions and roles of ICT as a potential factor that might contribute to retention of health workers in rural postconflict northern Uganda [24].\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nStudy design and sites\n\nThe study was conducted in the remote rural areas of six districts in northern Uganda of Adjumani, Amuru, Gulu, Kitgum, Lamwo and Pader, all of which were affected by the armed conflict between Uganda government forced and Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army rebels from 1986 to 2006. Participants in this study were stationed at the following health facilities; namely: Atanga HC III, Pajule HC IV, Pader HC III, Pajimo HC III,Palabeck HC III, Madi Opei HC IV, Padibe HC IV, Namokora HC IV, Atiak HC IV, Bobi HC III and Mungula HC IV. The 11 health centres were chosen based on two main criteria: being located in rural post-war northern Uganda and being used as training sites for medical students of Gulu University. This study was conducted as part of a larger ICT needs assessment study for Community Based Education Research and Services (COBERS) sites funded by Medical Education Partnership Initiative -Medical Education for Equitable Services for all Ugandan (MEPI-MESAU) support. COBERS is a practical hands-on medical training program at Gulu University, and it consists of supervised clinical, public health, laboratory and research training at rural health facilities.\n\n\nSampling\n\nParticipants from the eleven health centres were purposively sampled. For the purpose of this study, the participants that held in-charge or acting in-charge positions were eligible. Prior telephone calls were made to all the eleven health centres informing them of our study and the purpose of upcoming visits. Participants were informed that the study was voluntary and each of them contacted, willingly accepted to participate in the study and verbal consent was obtained from each of them. We conducted this study from 15th to 21st July 2014. A total of eleven interviews were conducted.\n\n\nData collection\n\nFace-to-face semi-structured interviews using an interview guide specifically designed for the study were conducted by YOW and TOG. Core guiding questions included the following: How do you describe ICT utilization by health workers at the health facility; describe how ICT can motivate you to stay and work in rural health facility; and kindly explain the barriers in the implementation of ICT in this rural health facility. YOW asked questions while TOG took notes during each interview. No audio/audio-visual recordings were made to avoid breach of confidentiality. The interview sessions lasted 30-45 min, with an average of 37.5 min per interview.\n\n\nData analysis\n\nData collected was transcribed, coded and thematically organised [28]. Qualitative thematic analysis of the interview was done as follows: the replies (notes) of each participant were typed under the corresponding questions in the interview guide (see questions under data collection). The demographic data was converted to quantitative data and a simple frequency table was constructed and reported (See Table 1). Themes arising from the interviews were presented as a direct compilation of the replies including direct quotes from participants (See verbatim quotes in text).\n\n\nResults\n\n\nParticipants\n\nEleven face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with eleven health workers categorised in Table 1.\n\nMale participants were disproportionately more than females. The imbalance in gender distribution is a reflection of more male involvement in positions of responsibility in the Ugandan health care delivery system, particularly in remote rural areas [29]. Medical officers and senior medical officers constituted almost half of interviewees. Within the Ugandan health care system, medical officers, senior medical clinical officers, medical clinical officers, nursing officers and laboratory assistants are stationed at Health Centre IV while nursing assistants, health assistants and enrolled nurses may work at both Health Centre IV or III. In this study, 5 of 11 participants were stationed at HC III. Participants at HC V were not included in this study as district hospitals did not qualify as remote rural health facilities.\n\n\nICT utilization by health workers\n\nEight out of the eleven participants indicated that they sometimes used computers. Of the eight health workers, six health professionals reported being able to use basic internet applications. Many interviewees were able to describe conditions of ICT use by health care providers in the health centres, describing conditions of ICT usage as characterised by little knowledge; some participants reported that they had never used computers and many could not confidently operate computers because of lack of knowledge and skills to do so. The basic knowledge they reported was applied to computer knowledge, especially in Microsoft Word application. Difficulties in using ICT by health workers became clear when all health workers and other government employees were obliged to acquire individual Tax Identification Number (TIN). A health worker in one district narrated what many of them faced due to inadequate computer knowledge.\n\n\"We had challenges when government this year 2014 tasked every employee to get Tax Identification Number (TIN). We had to pay about 10,000 -20,000 Uganda Shillings to people who are computer and internet literate to create for us e-mails and fill in the online Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) forms.\"\n\nDespite reporting low confidence, knowledge and skills in the use ICTs, many of the interviewees had positive perceptions of the benefits of ICT in supporting health services. When asked about their understanding of the benefits of ICT in health service delivery, interviewees were able to list the following: ICT can help in monitoring surgical operations, accessing knowledge of disease management and drug management, and managing medical records and other medical documents. Participants further reported that keeping data is made easy, tracking information is simplified and access to variety of news, and disease and treatment information through internet is possible with ICTs. Study done by Olok et al [30] in hospitals in northern Uganda indicated that ICT could offer benefits in the delivery of health services. A senior health worker in one district highlighted some of the unique benefits of ICTs as below:\n\n\"I strongly believe that ICT will improve reading culture for the health workers which will improve the quality of health services in rural post-war and post-conflict northern Uganda. Further, ICTs can support learning in the health centre coupled with supporting data work. I am very sure also that internet acts as a source of reference materials which bring creativity among health staff.\"\n\nGenerally, health workers in rural post-war and postconflict northern Uganda exhibited low confidence, knowledge and skills in the use of ICTs. However, health workers have positive perceptions of the benefits of ICT in health service delivery. Regarding the ICT related challenges they faced in ICT use, interviewees were quick to recommend training in ICT and internet skills for all the health workers in rural health centres in northern Uganda to prepare them for any ICT interventions, which may come from government and other health development partners.\n\n\nImproving health workers retention through ICT\n\nInformation and communication technologies were perceived by interviewees to improve retention in rural health centres in post-war conflict northern Uganda. A senior health worker in one district said: \"ICT is a big boost to health workers motivation\". One health Assistant in another district said: \"ICT will help motivate many of us to stay at the health centre because ICT, especially internet, makes a global home\". Since ICT is a resource that can aid the work of health workers, it can be viewed as one factor that influences them to continue working in rural health centres. A senior health worker in a district had the following to say: \"ICT will keep health workers busy; lack of ICT is the reason we leave the rural areas and move to urban so that socially, we are not disconnected. ICT will keep us together in the profession. Further, ICT brings to us health information resources such as e-books for one to update knowledge, support doctors in self learning and distance learning…we are being kept backward because we always get information last. I am very confident ICT will improve research in medicine at all levels of staffing at the rural health centres in northern Uganda.\"\n\nA Health Assistant in a district explained how ICT would help him stay and work in a rural health facility:\n\n\"I know there is little knowledge about ICTs but I also know that we can use it for entertainment, e-mails, elearning and linking to other doctors around the country; browse treatments and manuals from other health facilities and medical universities around the world…we will be able to enrol for health management course, which is now a necessity for all health workers in Uganda.\"\n\nIt appears clear that ICT introduction at rural health facilities might boost the retention of health workers in rural post-war conflict northern Uganda. Thus on the contribution of ICT to health care provider retention in northern Uganda, a senior health worker in a district said:\n\n\"I am certain computers and internet can motivate doctors to stay at one place because they will be sure to get information, leisure, entertainment and so on… staff mobility can reduce, I think by up to 60% … our stay will become easier and simpler especially when patients are not around; and also treatment of some sicknesses can be aided by access to the Internet. When computers and internet are available on site, then there will be no unnecessary movement because we will be in a global interconnected village through ICT.\"\n\nOne health centre actually had tried an innovative way to keep their staff at the health facility through the use of television. A senior health worker in the health facility concerned explained how she tried the use of digital satellite television (Dstv) to keep staff at the health centre and had this to say:\n\n\"For me, ICT is a very viable way for staff retention. Here, almost all the weekend health staff travel to town leaving only those on call at the centre. As a trial, I decided to install Dstv at the centre, which has helped me to keep almost all staff at the health centre. I expect availability of computers and internet to even do much better on staff retention than my Dstv.\"\n\n\nBarriers to the implementation of ICT in rural health centres\n\nThough ICT appears to contribute to the retention of health care providers in rural areas, many challenges might slow down it use, such as inadequate ICT knowledge and skills of health workers; poor internet connectivity; inadequate computers; inadequate electricity supply; lack of internet Modems; expensive access to outside computer centres; inadequate space for ICT; lack of ICT policy and inadequate ICT officers. For example a health worker in one district had this to say: \"Many of our staff can not confidently operate computers and they lack information, knowledge and skills to do so…the staff cannot also use computer applications and they need training.\" For internet access for example, health workers had to travel long distances to look for places with strong internet connectivity. A senior medical officer narrated this on poor internet network:\n\n\"Internet is not available at the health centre and not even at the trading centre. I think we truly have problems going to the district headquarter to look for internet. Whenever we go to the town about 47 km from the health centre, we travel together with medical students to access internet in town. The frequency of our travels is every after two days\". It is very difficult to predict how long this method can keep us going. All network services around are very poor although we have some kind of access to MTN and Airtel networks.\" Similar views were shared by a health worker in one of the remotest districts in northern Uganda.\n\n\"I think there is really urgent need to install ICT in this health centre. Imagine we are forced to travel 49 km to town just to do photocopying. Access to ICT facilities is very poor in this district in general and the only option now is to go to a town in a neighbouring district.\" Some health centres visited have computers, though inadequate and some in poor working conditions. Five health centres out of the 11 visited had no computers. A health worker in a district had this to say:\n\n\"For Health workers in this health centre, I do not think if any of us has ever used computers and internet. We have no computers here and health workers are not at all exposed to computer usage. We know the benefits of ICT but we can only turn these benefits to health services when computers are available and all of us know how to operate it. I can tell you that there is only one place here at a subcounty office where people access computer and internet services, but the ICT facility is not reliable and it is not accessible to all health workers.\"\n\nInadequate electricity supply also presents challenges to ICT implementation, as most rural areas in northern Uganda are not electrified. After the armed conflict in northern Uganda, many health centres received solar system as the main power supply. A senior health worker in a district explained:\n\n\"The main source of power supply at health centres after the war was solar. We are still continuing to use solar but many of the batteries have expired. The government main grid you see here is not yet functioning but electricity service poles are being installed. Some solar systems which we have are broken down. We currently run a generator which is again very expensive to sustain because of the expensive fuel.\"\n\nApart from the challenges that impede the availability and use of ICT facilities, the theft of existing infrastructures apparently affects rural health facilities in northern Uganda. A health worker said: \"This health centre had four new computers but unfortunately two were stolen before the gate was constructed. I can tell you that there is rampant stealing of computers from health centres. Just two week ago, one computer was reported stolen from a nearby health centre.\"\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nFollowing the ICT revolution, information and communication technologies appear to have become a vital infrastructural asset in health and in the retention of rural health care providers. Using qualitative study we explored the experiences and perceptions of health workers about their ICT use, benefits of ICT in health services, contribution of ICT to Health workers retention, and barriers to ICT implementation in rural postwar and post-conflict northern Uganda. Some participants reported low confidence, knowledge and skills to operate ICTs but reported positive perceptions on the benefits of ICT among health workers. What probably exists among health care providers in rural health facilities is the very basic computer knowledge, especially in Microsoft Word and internet applications. Our findings in the present study do not corroborate the findings in a study by Woodward and colleagues [5] in which health workers reported a range of engagement activities with ICTs. Woodward and colleagues [5] carried out their study in post-conflict situations targeting mainly health workers already experienced in ICT applications and usage. The unique contribution of our study is that we interviewed directly health workers engaged in a rural post-war and post-conflict situation where ICT applications are hard to comeby in health service delivery. The positive perceptions of ICT in this study however corroborate the study of Woodward and colleagues' study [5] who found that health workers had positive perceptions of e-health. These results especially mean that there is urgent need to invest in ICT in rural postconflict situations, create awareness of ICT and expose health workers to ICT and train them to use ICT in health service delivery. The positive perceptions of ICTs can be understood to indicate that health workers are willing to embrace ICTs in rural post-war northern Uganda.\n\nFindings of the study indicate that health workers perceived ICT availability and use to contribute to their retention in rural areas. Many studies have reported the contribution of ICT in retention of health workers [1,3,5,8] while other studies have reported the benefits of ICT in health care work processes [5,11,12,31]. In northern Uganda many health workers' retention strategies do not emphasise the role of ICT in addressing the needs and interests of health care providers but rather rely on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (traditional) strategies of retention [2,3,[15][16][17][18]. Our finding that ICT improves retention of health workers in rural situations is well placed. The results of our study appear to indicate that investing in health centres' ICT might prove to be one very important avenue for boosting retention of health workers in rural areas. In order for ICT to influence retention positively, there is need to train health workers [32]. Further, increasing the presence of ICT in rural health centres will likely improve retention and availability of health workers in rural areas including those in rural post-war conflict situations.\n\nDespite the other findings from this study, there are several barriers which appear to impede the implementation and use of ICTs in rural northern Uganda. These were inadequate ICT knowledge and skills of health workers; poor Internet services/networks; inadequate computers; inadequate power supply; expensive access to outside computer services from trading centres; inadequate space for ICT; lack of ICT policy and ICT officers. These barriers are similar to the findings of Woodward et al [5] in which poor, unreliable and unaffordable internet was reported. These current barriers need to be addressed directly by making ICT intervention one of the priority strategies in the plan for the reconstruction of post-war conflict situations. Massive training and investment in ICT facilities by government and other development partners based on the needs of health workers should be considered as a priority [32]. If ICT is to improve health workers' retention as aforementioned, then the elimination of the identified barriers should be one of the immediate steps to take in encouraging or fostering retention of health workers in rural areas. We wish, however, to point out that our participants equated ICTs mainly with computers and internet which were mainly used for word processing, data entry and communication purposes. There is now a range of ICT equipment other than desktop computers, all of which could be provided to rural health care providers. For example, several varieties of smartphones are now available on the Ugandan market that could as well help health care providers in rural areas keep in touch with professional colleagues, relatives, and friends, and to communicate and access health information right from their rural stations. In the training of health care providers, the diversification of available ICT infrastructures might need to be brought to the attention of health care providers.\n\n\nStudy limitations\n\nParticipants for the study were purposively sampled, selecting only the health centre in charges and those left in acting capacity. The study was also only based on interviewee perceptions. The leadership of health centres may not adequately be in position to address issues in regard to ICT interventions and retention as seen by other rural health facility staff. Further, our study did not adequately address activities considered when using ICT and our participants, by virtue of their management positions, might have been more exposed to the values and uses of ICT facilities. In this respect it might be considered that our results may be biased and skewed. However we believe that the information that our participants provided was based on wide experience based on their day-to-day interactions with other health facility staff. The information we have reported can therefore be regarded as a true reflection of the realtime situation of ICT facility availability, utilization and values in rural health facilities in post-war conflict northern Uganda. The strength of our study is that all participants were interviewed in their work places (health Centres) and were able to give exclusively what they felt and knew about ICT in rural northern Uganda. In addition, the interviews were done in eleven health centres spread over six districts in northern Uganda; the sample is geographically and reasonably representative of northern Uganda in terms of area coverage. Future studies might use a larger population of health workers, combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to study the use of ICT in improving population health in rural areas of Uganda. Despite its identified limitations, this study provided insight in to the perceptions of health workers about their ICT experiences, benefits of ICT in health services delivery, contribution of ICT to Health workers retention, and barriers to ICT implementations in rural situations in northern Uganda.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study explored the role of ICT in health care provider retention in rural northern Uganda. We identified low confidence, knowledge and skills to operate ICT among health workers as important factors to consider in promoting retention strategies in rural areas of Uganda. Positive health care provider perceptions of the benefits of ICT and its contributions to health workers' retention might facilitate retention of rural health workers. To improve health care provider retention in rural areas it might require investment in ICT infrastructural development along with offering training opportunities for most health care providers.\n\nTable 1\n1Characteristics of participants (N = 11)Gender \nFrequency \n\nFemale \n4 \n\nMale \n7 \n\nPosition \n\nMedical Clinical Officer \n1 \n\nLab Assistant \n1 \n\nNursing Assistant \n1 \n\nSenior Medical Clinical Officer \n2 \n\nHealth Assistant \n1 \n\nMedical Officer \n3 \n\nEnrolled Nurse \n1 \n\nNursing Officer \n1 \n\nTotal \n11 \n\nAcknowledgementThe authors thank all the interviewees for voluntarily and generously participating in the study.

Sheng et al. uses the Hindawi Publishing Corporation\nAn optimal control problem entails the identification of a feasible scheme, policy, program, strategy, or campaign, in order to achieve the optimal possible outcome of a system. More formally, an optimal control problem means endogenously controlling a parameter in a mathematical model to produce an optimal output, using some optimization technique. The problem comprises an objective (or cost) functional, which is a function of the state and control variables, and a set of constraints. The problem seeks to optimize the objective function subject to the constraints construed by the model describing the evolution of the underlying system. The two popular solution techniques of an optimal control problem are Pontryagin's maximum principle and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation[1].Optimal control has become a highly established research front in recent years with numerous contributions to the theory, in both deterministic and stochastic contexts. Its application to diverse fields such as biology, economics, ecology, engineering, finance, management, and medicine cannot be overlooked (see, e.g.,[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]). The associated mathematical models are formulated, for example, as systems of ordinary, partial, or stochastic differential equations or discrete dynamical systems, for both scalar and multicriteria decision-making contexts.This special issue is aimed at creating a multidisciplinary forum of discussion on recent advances in theory as well as applications. In response to the call for papers, 58 papers were received. After a rigorous refereeing process, 7 papers were accepted for publication in this special issue. The articles included in the issue cover novel contributions to optimal control theory as well as a broad spectrum of applications of optimal control from finance to resource management to engineering to marketing.The paper by Z. Lu and X. Huang investigates discretization of general linear hyperbolic optimal control problems and derives a priori error estimates for mixed finite element approximation of such optimal control problems.The paper by R. Wu et al. proposes, analyzes, and solves an optimal control exploiting model of renewable resources based on effective utilization rate and illustrates its solution numerically.The paper by N. Zulkarnain et al. compares the performance of an active antiroll bar system in an automobile using two control models, namely, the linear quadratic Gaussian and the composite nonlinear feedback controller.There are three works focusing on applications in economics and finance. The paper by J. Ma et al. studies the dynamics of an oligopoly model considering the output of an upstream monopoly and prices of two downstream oligopolies; it is shown that the long-run average profits of the three firms are optimal in the region of stability of the Nash equilibrium point.\n\nsible scheme, policy, program, strategy, or campaign, in order to achieve the optimal possible outcome of a system.

Its application to diverse fields such as biology, economics, ecology, engineering, finance, management, and medicine cannot be overlooked (see, e.g., [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]). The associated mathematical models are formulated, for example, as systems of ordinary, partial, or stochastic differential equations or discrete dynamical systems, for both scalar and multicriteria decision-making contexts.\n\nThis special issue is aimed at creating a multidisciplinary forum of discussion on recent advances in theory as well as applications. In response to the call for papers, 58 papers were received. After a rigorous refereeing process, 7 papers were accepted for publication in this special issue. The articles included in the issue cover novel contributions to optimal control theory as well as a broad spectrum of applications of optimal control from finance to resource management to engineering to marketing.\n\nThe paper by Z. Lu and X. Huang investigates discretization of general linear hyperbolic optimal control problems and derives a priori error estimates for mixed finite element approximation of such optimal control problems.\n\nThe paper by R. Wu et al. proposes, analyzes, and solves an optimal control exploiting model of renewable resources based on effective utilization rate and illustrates its solution numerically.\n\nThe paper by N. Zulkarnain et al. compares the performance of an active antiroll bar system in an automobile using two control models, namely, the linear quadratic Gaussian and the composite nonlinear feedback controller.\n\nThere are three works focusing on applications in economics and finance. The paper by J. Ma et al. studies the dynamics of an oligopoly model considering the output of an upstream monopoly and prices of two downstream oligopolies; it is shown that the long-run average profits of the three firms are optimal in the region of stability of the Nash equilibrium point. The paper by D.-L. Sheng et al. uses the constant elasticity of variance model to describe the dynamics of the risk asset and establish a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to solve the associated optimal control problem. An asset and liability management problem with stochastic interest rate is examined in the paper by H. Chang et al., who investigate an optimal investment strategy to maximize the expected utility of the terminal surplus.\n\nFinally, the paper by C. Colapinto and E. Benecchi uses a dynamic diffusion model of a TV series to analyze the evolution of electronic media transmissions and propose an optimal control model to assist the decision-maker with an optimal solution that balances the investment in a program's popularity sustenance and profit maximization.\n\n\nDavide La Torre\n\nHerb Kunze Manuel Ruiz-Galan Tufail Malik Simone Marsiglio\n \n.

China has a high diversity of tick species, 125 species have been reported, including 111 hard tick and 14 soft tick species. Many of the ticks are important vectors of pathogens, resulting in zoonoses. The dynamics of ticks are affected by both the host and habitat environment. However, systematic studies on the geographical distribution, host diversity, and specificity of ticks are limited in China. To achieve this goal, the relevant available data were summarized and analyzed in this study. Ticks are distributed in all parts of China and Xinjiang has the most records of ticks. The distribution of ticks in adjacent areas is similar, indicating that the habitat environment affects their distribution. Most ticks are widely distributed, whereas some species are endemic to their distributed regions. Ticks are parasitic on mammals, birds, and reptiles, of which mammals are the main host species. Overall, most ticks parasitize different hosts, only a few ticks have strict host specificity, such as ticks that are specifically parasitic on reptiles and bats. In addition, environmental changes and control efforts also influence the dynamics of ticks. These results can better reveal tick biological traits and are valuable for tick control.\n\n| INTRODUCTION\n\nTicks are obligate blood-sucking arthropods found throughout most regions of the world. Ticks infest every class of terrestrial vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and even amphibians (Sonenshine & Roe, 2013). Ticks are important to humans through the direct effects of their feeding and as vectors for various agents of disease in both man and livestock (de la Fuente, Estrada-Pena, Venzal, Kocan, & Sonenshine, 2008).\n\nMore than 16 specific tick-borne (or tick-caused) diseases of humans and more than 19 tick-borne diseases of livestock and companion animals have been described to date (Nicholson, Sonenshine, Lane, & Uilenberg, 2009). The frequencies of several tick-borne diseases and their geographical distribution are increasing, owing in part to climatic changes (Estrada-Peña, Ayllón, & De La Fuente, 2012;Gray, Dautel, Estrada-Peña, Kahl, & Lindgren, 2009). For example, the incidence of Lyme disease (LD), a well-known tick-borne disease, dramatically increased and spread to all parts of the United States in recent years (https://www.cdc.gov/ lyme/index.html). In addition, tick infestation causes economic losses due to body weight or milk production loss or treatment cost used for its prevention and control. For example, at least 80% of the world's cattle population are at risk from tick-borne diseases (Ghosh, Azhahianambi, & Yadav, 2007). Ticks cause a huge loss to cattle milk production conjugated with nutritional status and a poor management pattern in Ethiopia (Duguma, Kechero, & Janssens, 2012). Over 900 tick species have been identified to date globally, and they mostly belong to two families, the Ixodidae or hard ticks, and the Argasidae or soft ticks (Barker & Murrell, 2004;Guglielmone et al., 2010). Furthermore, hard ticks are divided into Prostriata (genus Ixodes) and\n\nMetastriata (remaining genera). In nature, most hard ticks are non-nidicolous, shelter in leaf litter, duff, rotting vegetation, or are buried in sand and under gravel and stones. Almost all of the non-nidicolous ones are species of the Metastriata subgroup of the Ixodidae. Most Argasidae and many Prostriata ticks are nidicolous, living in nests, burrows, caves, or other shelters used by their hosts or hiding close by. There are four stages, namely egg, larva, nymph, and adult in the life cycle of ticks. Ticks spend most of their life cycle off the host, exposed to these environmental conditions, and they will complete many important biological processes during the nonparasitic phase, such as moulting of engorged larvae and nymphs, oviposition of engorged females, incubation of eggs and host seeking. For larvae, nymphs, and adults, they need to feed or mate on the host at certain periods. The engorged ones detach from the host to seek shelter in a suitable microenvironment, where they can digest its meal and molt to the next stage. Depending on whether larvae and nymphs molt to the nymph or adult stage, respectively, off or on the host, hard ticks are classified as 3-, 2-, or 1-host ticks, and most of them have a 3-host life cycle, taking at least a year to complete their life cycle. However, life cycles of the soft ticks are more variable than those of hard ticks. For instance, soft ticks have multiple nymph stages that require a blood meal, and soft ticks tend to feed rapidly, whereas hard ticks tend to complete feeding processes that last days (Sonenshine & Roe, 2013).\n\nTicks have evolved several different strategies to facilitate their survival, while waiting for vertebrate hosts. In non-nidicolous species, the ticks crawl up emergent vegetation, where they wait for a passing host (the ambush strategy), and the questing periods might last many weeks or even months. Many tick species are able to survive for long periods because they can minimize evaporative water loss. Some ticks use the hunter strategy in host seeking, and they are attracted by CO 2, ammonia, and other odorants, emerge from their shelters and walk or run toward their hosts. Nidicolous ticks exhibit very different behavioral patterns than those of non-nidicolous species. They shelter in the nests or burrows of their preferred hosts (or close by).\n\nThere they are exposed to greater humidity and less extreme environmental conditions than their nonnidicolous relatives. These ticks rarely, if ever, are found questing outside of the host's dwelling. All stages of most of the nidicolous ticks feed on the same type of host. The nidicolous lifestyle often leads to host specificity, as it does to some degree in many species of Ixodidae ticks (J. Z. Liu & Yang, 2013;Sonenshine & Roe, 2013). Obviously, the life cycle and population dynamics of ticks are influenced by two factors, host seeking efficiency and host availability. The former factor is often associated with the population density, distribution pattern and activity periods of the host and the environmental conditions in tick seeking regions.\n\nHost availability refers to whether the host can be used or preferred by ticks. Previous studies have conformed two contrasting hypotheses concerning tick-host associations: Ticks select certain hosts in a given environment, and ticks select certain environments and feed on any available host within these (Cumming, 1998;Hoogstraal & Aeschlimann, 1982;Klompen, Black, Keirans, & Oliver, 1996;Nava & Guglielmone, 2013).\n\nIn a broad sense, the host specificity of ticks is quantified as the number of host species, or host range.\n\nHowever, meta-surveys found a significant correlation between host range and sampling effort and suggested that ticks are habitat rather than host specialists, thus simply counting the number of hosts used by ticks cannot fully reflect the host specificity degree (Cumming, 1998;Nava & Guglielmone, 2013). At the scale of the global geographic distribution of a species, ticks tend to be host generalists, and the ecological similarity of the host environment may be more important than host phylogenetic similarities in determining the ticks' host range. At a more local scale, host specialization seems to be the norm in ticks. In addition, the host range of ticks is often related to tick-borne pathogen circulation and disease risk (Mccoy, Léger, & Dietrich, 2013).\n\nTaken together, evaluating the host range of a particular tick species is more informative in understanding tick ecology and evolution.\n\nChina has a relatively high tick species diversity, and over 120 species (about 13% of world species) have been described across its geography and infesting different hosts (Bush & Robbins, 2012;Chao, Hsieh, & Shih, 2013;Chao, Lu, Lin, & Shih, 2017;Z. Chen et al., 2010;Deng & Jiang, 1991;Duan, 2013;T. Guo, Sun, Xu, & Durden, 2017;Y. Guo, Sun, & Xu, 2016;W. Li, Sun, Zhang, & Xu, 2015;Wen & Chen, 2016;Yin & Luo, 2007; X. Yu, Ye, & Gong, 1997). Owing to the medical and economic importance of ticks, increasing studies have paid more attention to tick biology (Z. Chen, Yu, Yang, Zheng, & Liu, 2009;J. Li et al., 2018;J. Liu, Liu, Zhang, Yang, & Gao, 2005;Ma et al., 2016), tick ecology (T. Wang et al., 2017;Zheng, Yu, Zhou, Yang, & Liu, 2012), and tick-borne disease (Chu et al., 2008;Fang et al., 2015;Wu, Na, Wei, Zhu, & Peng, 2013;Z. Yu et al., 2015), especially reports of the new emergence of tick-borne pathogens in recent years (H. Y. Z. Zhang & Xu, 2016). These extensive efforts provide valuable information for tick control. However, the studies with an emphasis on geographical distribution, host diversity, and specificity of ticks are limited to China. Many studies only briefly recorded the distribution and host of tick species at a local scale (G. P. Liu, Ren, He, Wang, & Yang, 2008;Y. Z. Wang et al., 2015;Y. S. Yang et al., 2008). In this present study, the geographical distribution, host diversity, and specificity of ticks in China will be discussed based on available data.\n\n\n| TICK SPECIES RECORDED IN CHINA\n\nThe data on tick species distributed in China are mainly obtained from published literature (Z. Deng & Jiang, 1991;Duan, 2013;T. Guo et al., 2017;Y. Guo et al., 2016;Wen & Chen, 2016;X. Yu et al., 1997). Wen and Chen (2016) also examined and revised the valid species names of the Argasidae ticks of the world. A total of 125 tick species have been recorded and described in the area of study. Based on these data, the detailed information on the valid species names and distributions are presented in Table 1. As shown, the Ixodidae family comprises 111 species from seven genera, Amblyomma (eight species), Anomalohimalaya (two species), Dermacentor (14 species), Haemaphysalis (43 species), Hyalomma (seven species), Ixodes (29 species), and Rhipicephalus (eight species), and the Argasidae family comprises 14 species from two genera, Argas (10 species), and Ornithodoros (four species). Considering that some new tick species and new recorded tick species were recently reported (T. Guo et al., 2017;Y. Guo et al., 2016;Wen & Chen, 2016), and China has a vast territory and various landscape types, the number of tick species in China will most likely increase in future study efforts. \n\n\n| GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF TICKS IN CHINA\n\nIn China, Deng and Jiang (1991)  In addition, there are many studies that focused on the geographical distribution of ticks at the province level (G. P. Liu et al., 2008;Y. Z. Wang et al., 2015;Y. S. Yang et al., 2008;Yu et al., 1997). Here, these data are reviewed and summarized, detailed information is present in Table 1 Without consider the sampling bias, as shown in Figure 1, Xinjiang has the most tick species records (49 species), followed by Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan, Fujian, and Taiwan, more than 30 species are found in these provinces. The provinces that have more than 20 species comprise Tibet, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei. Most of the remaining provinces have more than 10 species. It is worth noting that tick species records in Henan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Chongqing are relatively less, and tick species records in Beijing and Tianjin are lacking.\n\nEcological differences among these regions mainly result in differences in tick species records. For example, Xinjiang has different ecological types from inland areas and its livestock and wildlife are rich, so that many endemic tick species can survive in this region. Similarly, some endemic tick species are found in Tibet that is located in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Obviously, tick species records are strongly correlated with sampling and investigation efforts, ticks with great medical and agricultural importance receive more attention. In such cases, the tick species diversity of each province cannot be simply evaluated based on these records and more investigations of tick distribution are required, especially in areas where low numbers of tick species have been reported.\n\n\n| HOST DIVERSITY OF TICKS IN CHINA\n\nThere are differences in host distribution and diversity across tick distributed areas. In China, ticks can infest many vertebrates, including mammals, birds and reptiles, although their performances on these hosts remain largely unknown. X. J. Yang, Chen, Yang, and Liu (2008) have counted that about 130 animal species of 20 orders can be hosted by ticks in China. Of the 125 tick species examined in this study, nine species are from reptiles, 31 from birds, and 112 from mammals (Table 1). Furthermore, reptiles comprise lizards, snakes, and tortoises. Birds infested by ticks are mostly poultry, pigeons and wild birds. Like other studies, mammals are the main hosts of ticks,\n\nincluding Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Chiroptera, Insectivora, Lagomorpha, Perissodactyla, Pholidota, Primates, and\n\nRodentia. Among the mammal hosts, most tick species are found on Artiodactyla and Rodentia, with 80 and 42 species of ticks respectively. In addition, many ticks are found on domestic animals, including cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, rabbits, pigs, dogs, horses, and donkeys, which are marked as livestock in this study. These ticks will cause host body weight or milk production loss and act as reservoirs of diseases, thus they receive much attention (Yin & Luo, 2007; Z. Yu et al., 2015). Some tick species can infest different classes of animals. For example, larvae F I G U R E 1 Tick species recorded in each province in China and nymph ticks of Ixodes persulcatus are found on birds and small mammals. Cattle, pangolins and lizards are hosts of Amblyomma crassipes. These ticks that have wide host range may have adapted to different host types, including host habitats, host immunity, and so on. A series of experimental studies on the life cycle or reproductive barriers of ticks have also reinforced the hypothesis. In detail, under laboratory conditions, many ticks exhibited physiological plasticity as they can feed successfully using novel hosts not related to the natural hosts (Z. Chen et al., 2009;Faccini, Cardoso, Onofrio, Labruna, & Barros-Battesti, 2010;Labruna, Soares, Martins, Soares, & Cabrera, 2011;J. Liu et al., 2005;Ma et al., 2013;Olegário, Gerardi, Tsuruta, & Szabó, 2011;Pinter, Dias, Gennari, & Labruna, 2004). Meanwhile, these findings raise the possibility that the host diversity of ticks is undervalued, and various hosts can be used by ticks. Assessment of the host diversity of ticks is strongly affected by sampling bias and data record anomalies. In such cases, the influences of the two factors should be paid more attention to in investigating the host diversity of ticks.  (Hoogstraal & Aeschlimann, 1982). However, Klompen et al. (1996) concluded that adaptation to a particular habitat is more relevant for tick distributions than adaptation to a particular host. In a later study, Cumming (1998) suggested that both host specificity and ecological specificity could be important in determining tick distributional ranges and their evolution and that it depends on each particular tick species. A meta-analysis of host specificity in Neotropical hard ticks revealed that strict host specificity is not common among these ticks and suggested that the influence of tick ecology and evolution of habitat specificity, tick generation time, phenology, time spent off the host, and the type of life cycle could be more important than host species (Nava & Guglielmone, 2013). Although strict host specificity is not common in ticks in these studies, many ticks exhibited host specificity to varying degrees. Analyzing tick-host specificity at different taxonomic levels of both ticks and their hosts, Cumming (1998) revealed that most of the well-collected genera of African ticks are found mainly on mammals,\n\n\n| HOST SPECIFICITY OF TICKS IN CHINA\n\nwith Aponomma specializing on squamate reptiles, Carios on bats and Argas on birds. Furthermore, host preference is more obvious at a specific level, and at least 39 tick species exhibit specialization to a taxonomic level below class. Field observations suggest that even broad host generalists tend to feed on only a few main hosts locally, with these hosts changing across different areas of the distribution (Balashov, 2010). Significant patterns of local hostassociated genetic structure have been observed in several tick species (McCoy et al., 2013). In these cases, ticks have adapted to different environmental conditions and thus preferred different hosts depending on availability in a particular area.\n\nStudies of host specificity of ticks in China are relatively limited (Deng & Jiang, 1991). In this study, general patterns of tick-host specificity are described based on available data, although sometimes recorded data are incomplete. Some tick species were only found on a single host species, in such case, whether or not they have strict host specificity is not determined. Additionally, three tick species, Ixodes frontalis, Haemaphysalis primitive, and Argas robertsi, had no host records.\n\nIn general, hosts that can be used by ticks comprise reptiles, birds, and mammals. Among these tick species, nine species feed on reptiles, and five are specific for reptiles. Seven of the nine reptile-feeding ticks belong to\n\nAmblyomma genus (  (Cumming, 1998;Hoogstraal & Aeschlimann, 1982). Mammals serve as hosts for more tick species than do birds and reptiles, and at least one species of each tick genus utilizes mammals as hosts (Table 1). Artiodactyla are hosts for 80 tick species, including almost all tick genera found in China. Adult or immatures of these ticks utilize Artiodactyla as their main source of blood, and many of them also parasitize other mammals, birds, and reptiles. In contrast, only two species, Haemaphysalis kitaokai and Hyalomma isaaci feed on Perissodactyla, the former is also found on Artiodactyla, and the host range of another one also comprises Artiodactyla Overall, only a few ticks in China have strict host specificity, and most ticks can live on different hosts. These observations are consistent with previous results that analyze host specificity of ticks (Cumming, 1998;Hoogstraal & Aeschlimann, 1982;Klompen et al., 1996;Nava & Guglielmone, 2013 Another possibility is that adult and immature ticks occupy different habitats, where they can utilize different hosts (Hoogstraal & Aeschlimann, 1982).\n\n\n| TICK DYNAMICS UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AND CONTROL\n\nAs mentioned above, ticks spend most of their life cycle off hosts, exposed to environmental conditions that are largely altered by human activity and climate change. In a dynamic environment, the tick distribution and abundance and tick-borne disease risk will be strongly influenced. For example, Gray et al. (2009) reviewed the effects of climate change on several tick species in Europe. Robinson et al. (2015) revealed that both forested habitat and temperature were important drivers of LD spread in Minnesota, USA. In recent years, China's urbanization process is accelerating (M. Chen, Lu, & Zha, 2010), and industrial structures of agriculture and animal husbandry have been largely adjusted. These will cause changes in the suitable environment and preferred hosts of ticks, and influences of these changes on tick dynamics can be expected, although there is no systematic study on this issue. In contrast, many ticks are of medical and economic importance, and the prevention and control of ticks has always been received attention. In China, there are many effective control strategies for ticks, including rotational grazing (Dong et al., 2007), chemical control (Nong et al., 2013;Rajput, Hu, Chen, Arijo, & Xiao, 2006), biological control (Ren et al., 2012;Sun et al., 2013), and vaccine development (T. T. Zhang et al., 2017). In such cases, the dynamic changes in ticks also deserve further study.\n\n\n| CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE\n\nGeographical distribution, host diversity, and specificity of 125 tick species in China are reviewed in this study. The tick distributions varied across different regions, Xinjiang has the most tick species records, while few species are present in some provinces. Endemic and universal species are also observed. The distribution pattern is partly due to the different ecological environments in the distributed area. Ticks feed on mammals, birds, and reptiles, most species choose mammals as their hosts. Host diversity of soft ticks is lower than that of hard ticks. Furthermore, only a few ticks have strict host specificity, and most ticks can live on different hosts. These observations are helpful for research on tick ecology and biology. However, more efforts are needed to effectively control ticks and tick-borne diseases, including investigation of tick performance on different hosts, tick population dynamics and outbreak risk, mechanisms of tick biology and tick-pathogen interactions, and tick control strategies.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe \n\n\nhave revealed that tick species of Anomalohimalaya genus only occur in northern regions, whereas Amblyomma species are endemic in southern regions. Most of Dermacentor and Hyalomma species are mostly distributed in northern regions and their distributions in southern regions are scanty. Tick species of Haemaphysalis, Ixodes, and Rhipicephalus genera are widely distributed, but Haemaphysalis species are more frequent in the south and the other two genera are more common in the north. In a later study, Z. Chen et al. (2010) also described the geographical distribution of 117 tick species recorded in China and found that distribution of ticks appeared as spots or belts. In detail, about 70% tick species are endemic and exhibit spot distribution, they only occur in a single province or adjacent regions. These species have adapted to the distinct ecological conditions of their distributed regions. Although the universal tick species can cope with various ecological conditions and show belt distribution, these species account for about 30% of the population and many of them are the dominant species in China. For example, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Hyalomma scupense, and Rhipicephalus microplus distribute in most regions of China.\n\n\n, and the numbers of tick species recorded of each province are shown in Figure 1. As described in earlier studies, the geographical distributions of ticks are not even and variable among geographical regions. From an ecological perspective, the distributions of endemic and universal species are dependent on their adaption plasticity, when novel hosts occur or climate change within their habitat. Other factors that influence the distribution of ticks are the distributions and densities of available hosts, human activity, and tick control efforts.\n\n\nare grateful to Zhi-Jun Yu and Xiao-Long Yang of the College of Life Sciences, Hebei Normal University for their valuable comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

microplus that feed only on large ruminants). There are some debates about host specificity in ticks. Ticks have traditionally been considered as relatively host-specific, and their geographical distribution can be determined by that of their hostsAll tick species are obligate parasites, and their life cycles mainly depend on available food meals from suitable \n\nvertebrate hosts. Some tick species accept a wide variety of host species. For instance, Ixodes scapularis feed on \n\nlizards, birds, small mammals, and larger hosts like sheep and humans. Other tick species are more selective, and \n\nsome are extremely demanding and feed primarily, or solely, on one host species (e.g., \n\nTable 1 )\n1. Most of them are distributed in several adjacent provinces in southern regions, which have a similar ecological environment. A particular case is Haemaphysalis sulcate, which is reported from Xinjiang ZHANG ET AL. and its immature ticks feed on reptiles for survival. Birds serve as natural hosts for 31 tick species, including Ixodes, Haemaphysalis, Dermacentor, Hyalomma, Argas, and Ornithodoros genera(Table 1). Among them, eight species are strictly parasites of birds and 23 are occasionally found on birds or their immature ticks parasitize birds. Ticks of Argas genus generally use birds as their natural hosts. None of the Rhipicephalus and Amblyomma species are specific parasites of birds. Adult Dermacentor species never feed on birds; immatures rarely do so. These findings are consistent with previous studies| 11 of 15 \n\n\n\n\nand Lagomorpha. Ticks feeding on Carnivora are not specific parasites, which can be found among other animals, and most of them are of Ixodes and Haemaphysalis genera. Similarly, associations of ticks and mammals of Lagomorpha, Pholidota, Primates, and Rodentia are not strictly specific. However, only two Amblyomma species parasitize Pholidota, and reports of Anomalohimalaya species come from Rodentia. Fifteen tick species of six genera can attack humans in the natural environment, but humans are not their specific hosts. Four tick species, Ixodes vespertilionis, Ixodes simplex, Argas sinensis, and Argas vespertilionis parasitize bats exclusively.\n\n) .\n)Tick-host specificity is dependent on the life cycle of ticks, as adult parasitize a group of hosts, while immatures feed on different host groups. These examples include some species of Ixodes, Haemaphysalis, Dermacentor, Hyalomma, and Rhipicephalus genera, and most of the Dermacentor species accord with this pattern. These observations strongly suggest that some ticks have host preferences during different stages of their life cycle.\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTSThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.\nSignificance of Ixodid tick (Parasitiformes, Ixodidae) population structure for maintenance of natural foci of infection.

In VLC, information is transmitted through modulating the visible light spectrum (400-700 nm) that is used for illumination. Analytical and experimental work has shown the potential of VLC to provide high-speed data communication with the added advantage of improved energy efficiency and communication security/privacy. VLC is still in the early phase of research. There are fewer review articles published on this topic mostly addressing the physical layer research. Unlike other reviews, this article gives a system prespective of VLC along with the survey on existing literature and potential challenges toward the implementation and integration of VLC.Visible light communication (VLC) is a new paradigm that could revolutionise the future of wireless communication. In VLC, information is transmitted by modulating the visible light spectrum (400-700 nm) that is used for illumination. The information signal is superimposed on the LED light without introducing any flickering to the end user. Thus, it would be \"green\" as compared to providing two separate sources for illumination and communication network connectivity. On the other hand, the exhaustion of low-frequency bands to cope with the exponential growth for the highspeed wireless access is another reason for exploring new technologies. The visible light spectrum is unlicensed and hardware readily available, which can be used for data transmission. Furthermore, the exponential improvement in the high power light emitting diodes is an enabler for high data rate VLC Network. It has the potential to provide high-speed data communication with improved energy efficiency along with security/privacy. Standardisation efforts such as visible light communications association (VLCA) standards and IEEE 802.15.7 shows that VLC would augment existing wireless networks in coming years. VLC can have applications in indoor wireless communication [10], intelligent transport system [11,12], smart cities [13], localisation in warehouses/robotics [14-16], human sensing [17], safe and hazard-free data access in hospitals [18], toys and theme parks [19], indoor point to point (PPP) communication and vehicular communication [12].VLC in its basic form like any other communication system in the downlink consists of a LED as a transmitter, a free space optical communication channel and a photodetector or an image sensor as a receiver. The uplink could be a WiFi transmitter or an IR transmitter or LED based VLC transmitter. Much of the work is focused on the downlink transmission to increase the data rate and improve VLC performance under different environmental conditions such as shadowing, non-LOS scenario and mobility. However, the uplink is equally essential for seamless integration of VLC in the existing ICT infrastructure. Unlike other review articles, this paper provides an overview of the VLC from the uplink and system perspective. This review article critically analyses the existing solutions of the VLC network from the system as well as uplink perspective. This paper has following contributions\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the 1980s, the development of high-efficiency red, orange and yellow light emitting diodes (LEDs) have fueled the idea of replacing the solid-state lighting for illumination purpose. It was until 1996 when the first white LED was commercially introduced in the market for sale [1]. LED lights are highly powered efficient, low carbon emissions, free from mercury, durable and produce good quality illumination. LED lights have 75% less power consumption and last 25% longer than traditional incandescent lamps [2]. With the decreasing prices and low power consumption of LED's, it is estimated that the market share of LED lighting would increase to 69% in 2020 [1].\n\nThe exponential growth of data in the last two decades has raised concerns over the electricity consumption of information communication technology (ICT) infrastructure. It was estimated that ICT infrastructure accounted for 4.6% of worldwide electricity consumption in 2012 and projected to increase in the future despite emphasising on the introduction of power efficient technologies [3,4]. By 2030, the contribution of the ICT in greenhouse release would increase up to 23%, and at the worst, it can go up to 50% [5]. The future of the internet of everything (IoE) connecting people, processes, things, data and everything would require internet connectivity at all times. IoE would further increase the deployment of ICT infrastructure, thus increasing the power consumption. Apart from providing illumination at low-cost, LED lights have been used in several other applications, e.g., indoor farming and plantation [6,7], medical applications [8,9]. The easy availability of LED lights at home, offices and public spaces make it an affordable candidate to deal with the radio frequency (RF) spectrum scarcity as well as providing an energy efficient communication system. It is envisioned that existing lighting infrastructure should provide illumination as well as data connectivity.\n\n\n•\n\nWe have critically analysed the existing literature of the VLC regarding the uplink from the user device to VLC access point (VAP).\n\n\n•\n\nWe have discussed the open challenges associated with the use of existing RF spectrum for uplink connectivity.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follow: Section 2 discusses the history and standardisation efforts. Section 3 discusses applications of VLC. Section 4 gives an overview of the different technologies used in the uplink and discusses its limitation. Section 5 summarises open research challenges toward the integration of VLC in the existing systems. Section 6 concludes the paper.\n\n\nVisible Light Communication System\n\nIn the early 1990's, mobile phones were mainly used for voice conversation or text messaging. However, the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 has started a new era in wireless communication [20]. Nowadays smartphones are equipped with all kinds of sensors and applications to provide health monitoring, video chatting, online streaming along with bank transactions and using cloud services. A larger bandwidth should be allocated for wireless communication in order to provide seamless connectivity and higher data rates. However, frequency spectrum below 5 GHz is well utilised, which leave no room to relocate spectrum for mobile communication. This led scientists to seek new wireless technologies that can fulfil the needs of the higher data rate at a low cost. One such candidate is the use of the visible light spectrum. It has the advantage of its availability (LED lights), link level security, higher bandwidth, and frequency reuse. Furthermore, the demand for data is higher in an indoor environments because 80% of the time people stay in an indoor environments [21]. Thus using the VLC in indoor applications for high data rate applications would free up the precious RF spectrum for other future applications such as autonomous cars and smart cities.\n\nThe history of VLC goes back to Romans when polish metallic plates were used to reflect sunlight and convey signals over a long distance. In 1794, Claude Chappe developed a semaphore system consisting of a series of towers equipped with mounted arms to transmit information. In the late 19th and early 20th Century, heliograph was used for long distance communication. In heliograph, the sunlight was reflected with a mirror to transmit Morse code. The British and Australian armies used it till 1960. Graham Bell is mostly known for his invention of the modern telephone, which uses electricity to transmit voice. However, Bell described the photo-phone as one of his important inventions [22]. Photophone uses voice to vibrate the mirror, which in turn is used to modulate the sunlight. It was the idea of Graham Bell, which led to fibre optic communication. The first commercial fibre optic communication system was deployed in 1975 and was capable of operating at a bit rate of 45 Mbit/s. VLC is a form of optical communication that instead of using a guided media (fibre optic) operates in the open air in close proximity of two to three meters. In 2003, the term VLC was coined first by Nakagawa Laboratory at Keio University, Japan [23]. The Nakagawa Laboratory demonstrates the first VLC system at Keio University in 2000. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are used for transmitting the data.\n\nLiang et al. have proposed a VLC system consisting of red-green-blue (RGB) LEDs as a transmitter and complimentary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor as a receiver [24]. The authors observe that RGB LEDs can increase the VLC transmission data rate with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). For such systems, colour signals are isolated using colour filter array which relies on colour-sensitive sensing elements. However, the wide optical bandwidth of colour filters can increase spectral overlap between channels and can cause inter-channel interference (ICI). In order to solve this issue, the authors have applied CMOS image sensors with multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) to mitigate the ICI and demodulate the rolling shutter pattern.\n\nIn [25,26] Different research groups have demonstrated that a single gallium nitride (GaN)-based LED can achieve a data rate of up to 4 Gb/s [28,29]. A high data rate of up to 15 Gb/s and 13.5 G b/s using a GaN blue laser diode was achieved for a distance of 15 cm and 197 cm, respectively [30].\n\nZafar et al. have explored laser diodes (LDs) as an alternative to LEDs for visible light communication [31]. The use of micro LEDs can significantly improve modulation bandwidth and can provide data rates of up to 3 Gbps. However, at a high data rate, current LEDs might suffer from efficiency droop which can occur due to electron overflow. This might increase the cost of LEDs as LED will not be operating at optimum efficiency in high data rate scenarios. In contrast to LEDs, LD can offer higher direct modulation bandwidth and can provide good optical-to-electrical conversion efficiency without drooping. Therefore it is expected to provide high performance due to the characteristics of high optical power and light beam conversion. This could be used as an alternative to LEDs for illumination and data transmission. While LDs have several advantages over LEDs, LDs have many challenges of their own such as speckles, power limitations and cost that needs to be addressed. Nevertheless, VLC is still in its development phase, various features of LDs must be considered in future VLC scenarios.\n\nWatson et al. have developed a VLC system based on GaN laser diodes aimed at unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) [32]. The low loss of blue spectrum originating from laser makes LDs good option for underwater communications compared to traditionally used acoustic systems which are slow and proven to be susceptible to interception. Laser-based VLC systems which traditionally use non-return-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK) could achieve data rates of up to 4 Gibts/s. The authors of this study have used direct modulated GaN LD which emit light at 450 nm, and a data rate of 4.7 Gbits/s is achieved. Additionally, the underwater tracking system is developed, that, along with tracking, can provide data transmission as well.\n\n\nStandarisation Efforts\n\nIn 2003, a VLC consortium (VLCC) was formed to speed up the research and commercialisation of VLC. The VLCC proposed two standards by 2007 [23]; JEITA CP-1221 (VLC system) and JEITA CP-1222 (VL ID system) that was later accepted by Japan electronics and information technology industries association (JEITA). CP-1223 was introduced as a VL beacon system in 2013. Both these standards have meagre data rates of up to 4.8 Kbps.\n\n2.1.1. IEEE 802. 15.7 Due to increasing interest of researchers in VLC, the VLCC has introduced the first IEEE 802.15.7 standard in 2009 [33]. The standard defines the physical and media access control (MAC) layer parameters for short-range optical wireless communication. It covers topics such as network topologies, modulation domain spectrum, MAC protocol specification, collision avoidance, addressing, performance, quality indicators, dimming support, coloured status indication, and stabilisation. The standard proposes one-off keying (OOK), color shift keying (CSK) and variable pulse position modulation (VPPM) techniques for indoor and outdoor communication [34]. The highest achievable data rate for indoor communication can go up 96 Mb/s. However employing the multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) system and other modulations scheme, the data rates can be improved significantly.\n\n\nOpenVLC\n\nWang et al. have proposed and demonstrated an OpenVLC system, rapid prototyping, flexible and open source VLC system for the research community [35]. It provides an interface between VLC front-end with the embedded Linux platform. The hardware consists of beaglebone black board (BBB), and a transceiver front end consisting of a single LED which can serve both as the transmitter and receiver. A single LED in dual mode is used to reduce design complexity. A software-defined switch operates the transceiver. In transmitter mode (Tx) the LED is connected to the power amplifier, and in the receive mode (Rx) it is connected to a low noise amplifier. OpenVLC has implemented both the time-division duplex and IEEE 802.15.7 protocol that includes software programmability, carrier sensing, TCP/IP interoperability, encoding and decoding, preamble detection and signal sampling. The upgraded version of OpenVLC1.3 improves the data rate from UDP throughput of 100 kbps (in OpenVLC1.2) to 400 kbps without any modifications to the existing hardware [36]. It also reduces physical footprint (as it runs on off the shelf microcontroller) along with memory efficient frame detection technique. Techniques were introduced to reduce noise due to high-frequency components along with the synchronisation issues of the frame receptions. OpenVLC facilitates the research of VLC both for academia and industry.\n\nIn [37] authors have challenged the assumption that light sources are always static and users can expect LOS with many luminaries, and many scenarios together can provide deterministic localisation. The authors observe that these assumptions may not hold for many scenarios. For example, when the nodes consist of a single light and are mobile (e.g., bikes or swarms of robots) the localisation become non-deterministic. A framework is proposed to compute the relative position of objects when nodes are moving freely in all directions. The proposed framework has been implemented with OpenVLC platform. A good error rate of below 5cm is achieved through simulations.\n\nIn [38] an inexpensive receiver has been designed to cope with the issues arising due to optical noise and the mobility of users. This receiver is based on the OpenVLC platform; photodetectors are utilised to sense optical noise arising from the sun and other sources. The physical and data link layers are modified to adjust the receiver to the detected noise. Experiments were conducted for two nodes trying to maintain a link under different paths (e.g., straight and curved) and illuminations (e.g., night and day). Results validate that the noise sensing with photodetector outperforms LED only design in optical noise and mobility.\n\n\nApplications\n\nThe concept of the IOE expands the network connectivity to the intelligent connection of people, data, processes, things, machine and everything. IoE would require internet connectivity for billions and trillions of sensors to provide ubiquitous, seamless services to people, machines, process, and things. All these applications would have a different set of requirements such as high data rate in Giga b/s, reliability, availability and security. The ease of availability, low cost and high data rates of VLC could make it a relevant wireless communication technology that would cater to all kind of future applications. Some of the potential applications of VLC are discussed as follow.\n\n\nIntelligent Transport System (ITS)\n\nNearly 1.2 million people die in a traffic-related incident every year, and an estimated 50 million get injured [39]. Researchers have shown that most of the incidents are due to the slow response and inability of automobile drivers to take the right action at the right time [40]. In ITS, vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and infrastructure to vehicle (I2V) communication ensures the safety of people, traffic flow and comfort of drivers as shown in Figure 1. ITS relies on reliable, robust and secure communication among vehicle and infrastructure (traffic lights, billboards). VLC is proposed for ITS communication to complement or replace the existing crowded RF-based communication [11,12]. All vehicles are equipped with head and tail lights that can be used for transmitting information. Traffic lights or billboards can also be used for sharing useful information about the road, traffic and weather conditions. These lighting sources can also be used for providing data connectivity to users and IoE entitites. Cȃilean et al. have discussed challenges facing VLC in the context of vehicular communication (VC) [41]. Increasing communication range, enhancing mobility and data rates are the main requirements for VC. The accomplishment of these objectives depends on the ability of communication channels to be resistant to parasitic light (PL). The outdoor channels are exposed to different kinds of PLs. It is observed that VLCs distance measuring and localisation capabilities could be beneficial in VC applications. Further, it is suggested that the development of heterogeneous systems consisting of VLC and dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) (or any other RF-based scheme) could lead to a reliable system for VCs as each of these technologies can make up for each other deficiencies. In this regard, a survey of VLC concerning 5 GHz DSRC in a hybrid arrangement is conducted. It is concluded that VLC systems aimed at VCs can be improved by exploring and integrating new technologies which include but are not limited to software-defined architecture, resource sharing, reconfigurable computing and integration of new materials. Ucar et al. have developed a hybrid 802.11p and VLC secure autonomous platoon system [42]. The autonomous platoon uses RF based 802.11p and consists of a platoon leader that controls other members to adjust the speeds stably. A 802.11p and VLC hybrid vehicular platoon communication protocol, named as SP-VLC is proposed. This protocol is aimed at addressing security vulnerabilities due to the exclusive use of RF communication. A simulation platform for the vehicle mobility and vehicle platoon managementis is developed. SP-VLC is evaluated under different security vulnerability scenarios. The simulation results validated the observations made in [41] that RF-VLC heterogeneous systems can provide many advantages over the RF only system. Kunar et al. have proposed to integrate LED-based road side units (RSU) into the existing ITS infrastructure [43]. The RSUs are used to broadcast information in infrastructure to vehicle (I2V) mode using VLC concepts. A robust modulation technique based on a direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and sequence inverse keying (SIK) is employed to minimise the effect of noise sources. The amount of data received by a car passing by RSU is considered as a performance metric. The experimental setup involves a movable receiver and a stationary emitter both separated by a distance of 1.5 m. Results show that packet error rate (PER) degrades linearly with distance during daylight while at night the packet error varies due to the local nature of artificial light.\n\nIn [44] performance evaluation of VLC based V2V systems has been conducted. For performance evaluation, a typical V2V VLC scenario is considered with left and right headlamps emitting light. The reflected rays are considered to have both line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (LOS) components with the Lambertian profile. Results show that depending on the headlamp location a data rate of 50 Mbps can be achieved at a separation distance of 70m between vehicles.\n\nIn [45] the authors have considered VLC-based ITS for accident avoidance, particularly, when lorry fleet are moving through intersections. VLC has been used to send signals related to acceleration, deacceleration and braking to ITS infrastructure (e.g., RSUs) which can trigger appropriate signal. For example, to reduce the number of emergency brakes and lane change in a complex environment, a lorry fleet can send VLC signal to RSU which can set a green signal or express path.\n\nYamazato et al. have used VLC with imaging sensor-based receiver for automotive applications [46]. Two scenarios I2V and V2V are considered. The first scenario consists of a transmitter designed from LED arrays (assumed to be RSUs) while the receiver is considered to be high frame rate CMOS imaging camera. In the second scenarios, a special CMOS sensor have been developed which can receive high-speed optical signals. In the field trials, a data rate of 32 kb/s and 10 Mb/s is achieved for I2V and V2V, respectively.\n\n\nSmart Cities and Smart Homes\n\nSmart cities are envisioned to provide seamless connectivity between people, government, infrastructure, economy and environment [13,47]. Most of the functional entities of a smart city are already available around us. However, the reliable, sustainable and high data rate wireless connectivity is the bottleneck to connect all the enablers. The already available infrastructure of lightning (street lights, parking lights, billboards) can be utilised to provide high-speed, low energy and sustainable network connectivity for some applications (e.g., utility services) in smart cities whereas freeing up the precious RF spectrum for other mobile applications. Street lights or other lighting sources could be used as a hotspot to provide extremely high data rates to the user.\n\nA three-layer VLC based communication architecture is proposed to integrate different technologies in smart cities' applications seamlessly [48]. Layer one uses VLC to allow user access and a sense of events. Layer two provides communication between different LEDs and sub gateways. The last layer provides communication between different sub gateways and the service gateway using optical communication. Based on this architecture several applications (such as intelligent communication, event surveillance, and object tracking) have been demonstrated. In [49], authors have investigated optimisation algorithms to provide consistent received optical power and signal to noise ratio (SNR) across a single receiver plane in smart homes.\n\nIn [50] a hardware design and location identification protocol are demonstrated for a VLC-based indoor positioning system for smart supermarkets. The hardware design considers the illumination flickering, brightness, signal synchronisation and noise in the indoor environment. Various practical user conditions have been used to optimise the hardware and software implementation in terms of location accuracy and bit error performance. It is concluded from the experimental work that location ID detectability is 95% for a distance of 0.7 s and under the illumination in diameter of 2 m.\n\n\nEntertainment and Advertisement Industry\n\nVLC requires line of sight (LoS) or semi line of sight. This can be used for applications requiring access to localise information. Theme parks, toy or advertisements are such applications, where the aim is to produce products with reducing costs. For example, most of the toys are battery powered and operates in LoS, and typically require a wireless connection to control the toy [51]. Some researchers have explored battery-free VLC communication system. Xu et al. have developed a new VLC based communication, called passive VLC that uses the backscatter communication for battery-free IoT applications [52]. This system is based on RetroVLC which tackles the challenges of directional communication and low optical coupling (mostly less than 20% via solar panel) for wideband VLC. RetroVLC uses the concept of retroflecting which involves sending light back, almost, along with the incoming path, achieving a pointed communication. Miller codes are used to double bandwidth utilisation compared to Manchester coding. Trend-based modulation and code-assisted demodulation are proposed for reducing the modulation time. Two proof of concept systems are developed to validate their proposed scheme. A data rate of 1Kbps was achieved with the RetroVLC system.\n\nA single LED light can be used for transmission and reception as well as providing the visualisation to entertain kids. This would save energy and cost, also not polluting the precious RF spectrum. Another use of VLC could be in the advertising industry, where large billboards made of LED's are used for advertisement. Such large billboards with high light intensity and equipped with hundreds of LED 's can be used for providing free outdoor network connectivity that can work as hotspots for users, machines or smart cities applications.\n\n\nHospitals\n\nVLC operates in 430-770 THz, and due to nanometer wavelength, it cannot penetrate in objects, therefore making it ideal for applications where confidentiality of data is of utmost importance. The inherent security and safety feature of VLC provides an alternate of wireless communication that could be used to minimise health risks associated with radio frequency radiations. One such area is hospitals, where VLC can be utilised for monitoring patients, machine to machine communication, record keeping of patients and all other networking applications [53]. Newborn babies are fragile and vulnerable to even small RF radiations of the ISM band and cellular frequencies. Implementation of VLC in newborn babies wards would be a natural choice for monitoring and indoor connectivity to the rest of the internal and external networks. To replace the existing wireless communication in hospitals, a broadband powerline and VLC with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is demonstrated [53]. Abdaoui et al. have proposed another hybrid system consisting of VLC and 60 GHz RF for e-health applications [54]. The rationale of VLC for these applications as it is easily available in hospitals and can reduce communication system cost. As VLC offers only downlink communication, therefore, 60 GHz RF to provide uplink communication is used. Apart from uplink, 60 GHz can be used for localisation as well. It is concluded that this hybrid system could be used efficiently to collect a wide range of information from the patients.\n\nChow et al. [25] have demonstrated secure data transmission that can have applications in a hospital environment. In [25] authors have proposed a CMOS camera-based VLC system which encrypts emitted light. The transmitter consists of an encryption module which receives an optical signal that is encrypted using a private key or another advanced encryption scheme and is then emitted. The CMOS-based mobile camera is used as a receiver. The rolling shutter feature of the CMOS camera is used to enhance data rates. An additional Otsu thresholding module is used to get effective BER. The proposed scheme gives good results in terms of BER and encryption.\n\nA communication system inspired by barcoding technology is proposed [55]. Unlike VLC, this system considers that without explicitly modulating a light source, the disturbances in the natural (e.g., sun) can be used to convey information and thus it is named as a passive communication system. It involves the design of a communication channel in which information is captured from the mobile elements with wear patterns consisting of distinctive surfaces. A user can be reduced to a \"tiny-box\" equipped with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) photodiode. Massive deployment of these tiny boxes can infer significant pieces of information from the surrounding. Such systems are deployed in hospitals where emergency, treatment and housing trolleys can report their physical locations. A key aspect of this system is sustainability in terms of infrastructure (as it needs of minimum infrastructure changes), energy efficiency (as the system uses only photodetectors which are energy efficient compared to the camera used in similar scenarios) and cost (as photodetectors are inexpensive). The passive communication system is demonstrated in the parking area and reported encouraging results.\n\n\nHybrid VLC\n\nA VLC network arrangement is shown in Figure 2a. The downlink consists of a LED driver which drives the LED illuminator to work as a VLC transmitter and a power line modem to connect the VLC transmitter to the network. For simplification, this downlink VLC transmitter is called a VLC access point (VAP). The power line communication (PLC) technology is typically utilised to connect all the VAPs to the rest of the network both internally and externally. In the user devices, the downlink VLC transmission can be received either through a photodiode or an image sensor. The uplink from the user device could be through either (a) VLC transmitter, (b) a wireless fidelity (WiFi) link, (c) an infrared (IR) link, (d) a combination of any two. Figure 2b shows another arrangement of the VLC network. An IR transmitter is used on the uplink instead of a WiFi. In this scenario, VAP consists of PLC modem, VLC transmitter, and an infrared receiver (IR). The user device consists of a photodiode to receive the downlink VLC transmission and an IR transmitter to communicate on the uplink. Both IR and VLC require line of sight for communication. Instead of an IR transmitter, we could use a LED transmitter for the uplink to make a bidirectional VLC link. However, as light would be continuously emitting in an upward direction, which is aesthetically not pleasing from a user perspective.  In any case, the VLC would occur through a heterogeneous network that would be using more than one networking standard, i.e., a combination of PLC-VLC, PLC-VLC-WiFi, PLC-VLC-IR. There are limitations of each existing technology to support VAP. For example, PLC is used to connect the VAP with the rest of the network. PLC can achieve a data rate of 1 Gbit/s [56,57]. Thus creating a bottleneck to use VLC for high data rates although theoretically, VLC can provide high-speed data up to 15 Gbit/s [30]. Some researchers have considered fibre optic as an alternative to PLC [58]. However, it will increase infrastructure cost. Figure 3 shows a typical deployment of VLC network in a house. It consists of a heterogeneous network of PLC-VLC-WiFi. One WiFi AP is used to cover the entire house whereas VAP's are distributed throughout the house and connected via PLC to the main gateway. This arrangement is cost effective and realistic as typically the links are asymmetric considering that uplink can have low data rates as compared to downlink transmission. VLC users at the boundary of WiFi would have high signal attenuation, which could deteriorate the overall throughput. A second arrangement is to deploy low power WiFi transmitters (WiFi Direct) in VAPs. However, it would increase the complexity of hardware and software in VAP. Furthermore, VAP's are prone to interference as it cannot penetrate objects due to characteristics of its frequency. However, WiFi operates in 2.4 and 5 GHz range, and it can penetrate in walls. Therefore fine tuning WiFi transmitter to a very small area would be practically unachievable. This will increase the interference among wifi transmitters in close proximity. A third alternative is to deploy multiple WiFi to provide good coverage and throughput, but it would require excellent RF planning to mitigate interference issues. We will discuss this in detail later in the next subsection. In most of the cases, photodetectors are employed as a receiver for the VLC. However CMOS sensor-based camera are also experimented with and demonstrated for reception of visible light and extracting information from it. Danakis et al. have developed a proof of concept system which shows that rolling shutter feature of CMOS sensors can be used to achieve higher data rates [59]. The overall system consists of an LED transmitter, a mobile camera-based receiver, and an Android application equipped with a decoder. The information is captured in a mobile phone as a light and dark band which can be decoded by mobile phones to retrieve information.\n\n\nWiFi-VLC\n\nWiFi (wireless fidelity) is a trademark of WiFi Alliance, based on the 802.11x family of Ethernet standard for wireless local area networks (WLANs). Devices can connect to the internet via a WLAN access points (APs). WiFi is primarily used for internet access in the indoor environment connecting via wire to the backbone network [60] as shown in Figure 3. WiFi direct is another variant of WiFi, providing direct connectivity between user devices without any intermediate device [61].\n\nThe main application of VLC is to provide high-speed connectivity in an indoor environment. Light fidelity (LiFi) is one such indoor application of VLC, proposed by Herald Hass in 2011 [62]. LiFi promises a fully networked indoor system with bidirectional support for point-to-point (P2P) and multipoint-to-point communication (MP2P). It also provides the capability of multi-access points and the formation of wireless networks between them resulting in LiFi atto cells (comparable to femtocells). These atto cells provide seamless handover and promise to provide full user mobility. Different researchers have proposed different system models for LiFi [63][64][65][66]. One of the proposed models is to augment LiFi with WiFi, where the latter works as an overlay network over on the former. In another approach, a mixed WiFi and LiFi is used to provide an aggregated system providing aggregated channels for communication. Light radio (LiRa) is another application developed by augmenting VLC with legacy WiFi [64]. LiRa does not require VLC for the uplink transmission by the mobile client and instead employs a WiFi uplink. The system achieves VLC automatic repeat request (ARQ) feedback via WiFi without excessive delay with a newly introduced method, AP-spoofed multi-client ARQ (ASMA). This method provides the mechanism to minimise the impact of VLC control frames on legacy WiFi traffic while providing enough feedback for the visible light downlink.\n\nKhreishah et al. [66] proposed a VLC-WiFi hybrid system for energy efficiency. An analytical framework for energy efficiency is proposed that is based on two requirements; (a) selection of the appropriate number of APs to provide the lighting, (b) to satisfy the user's request for real-time communication. The results showed that the VLC-WiFi hybrid system is 75% more efficient than a standalone WiFi network. Kashef et al. carried out a similar investigation for energy efficiency and LOS availability of a VLC-RF hybrid system [67]. The system parameters that affect the energy footprint of the communication system are analysed. Results showed that energy efficiency improved at the cost of less LOS availability.\n\nShao et al. have proposed two variants of hybrid systems as proof of concept for the coexistence of WiFi and VLC [68]. In the first phase, a WiFi-VLC hybrid system is proposed where VLC is used for the downlink and WiFi for the uplink transmission. Results have shown that higher data rates can be achieved compared to the conventional WiFi systems. In order to take advantage of the higher bandwidth of VLC on the downlink and exploit the higher availability and range of WiFi, the hybrid systems are further enhanced by bundling together WiFi and VLC channels using bonding techniques based on the concept used in the Linux operating system. Practical experiments are performed in the crowded environments for comparing the hybrid system with WiFi only system. Robustness and throughput are used as performance metrics. Results have shown that hybrid systems are robust and provide higher throughput compared to WiFi systems.\n\nIn [69], a hybrid system has been developed which consists of optical femtocells overlaid over WiFi cells, named as WiFO. The WiFO exploits the high bandwidth of optical femtocells and high mobility of WiFi to provide high throughput along with seamless handover and good bit error rate (BER). This system involves, among other components, a custom network protocol with physical, link, network and transport layers, to support the developed system. While other layers are similar to traditional networking layers, the networking layer, however, is modified significantly to provide seamless mobility in addition to routing packets. The authors have performed experiments and have shown that the optical femtocells in the WiFO could achieve a data rate of up to 50 Mbps at a distance of 3 m.\n\nIn [70], a hybrid VLC and RF system is considered that exploits the longer range of RF to provide control functions and increase per user rate coverage of the VLC cells. It quantifies the minimum spectrum and power requirements which can achieve a certain per user outage performance. The hybrid system consists of central unit (CU) which assign users to either VLC or RF network based on the user's channel conditions (users with the low data rate in the VLC network are migrated to RF network). The proposed system is evaluated for two scenarios, D1 and D2. In D1 power and spectrum are kept constant while in D2, CU dynamically adjusts power and spectrum according to the traffic demands. Results have shown that that D2 outperforms D1.\n\nIn [71] a hybrid VLC and RF system has been proposed which aims to support diverse quality of service (QoS) needs of users. The QoS needs are studied for limits on the buffer overflow and delay violation probabilities. Results show that RF performs better for arrival rate in some settings, while VLC has better delay performance.\n\nIn [72] a hybrid WiFi-VLC system has been implemented which consists of two duplex links. One is an aggregate of VLC and WiFi, and the other is WiFi duplex link. WiFi is used for the uplink transmission. The Linux bonding technique is used to achieve link layer aggregation using the Linux bonding driver to build a logical interface (LI) on the client. Throughput and round-trip time (RTT) of the hybrid systems are evaluated under different contention scenario and VLC operating distances. The proposed system was benchmarked against the conventional WiFi and a hybrid WiFi-VLC system (non-aggregate system with asymmetric VLC downlink and WiFi uplink). Experiments have shown that the throughput of the aggregate system outperforms the standalone WiFi and a conventional WiFi-VLC hybrid system. The RTT of the aggregate system shows considerable improvement over the benchmark system particularly when the WiFi is facing congestions.\n\nMost of the existing work in VLC-WiFi hybrid system is based on a single VAP in a confined area. WiFi is used for uplink in close proximity similar to WiFi direct. As shown in Figure 3, one WiFi AP can cover multiple VAP's. However, WiFi signals attenuate over the distance, which would increase the errors in the uplink and thus feedbacking in the downlink to decrease the data rate. As the VAP is deployed at multiple locations to cover a large indoor area, then the collaboration between different VAP and one or more WiFi is not evaluated. This creates a bottleneck towards the scalability of VLC-WiFi network. Furthermore, there has been less reported work on the cost, fault tolerance, security and overall throughput of the systems.\n\n\nIR-VLC\n\nMost of the current research relies on IR or RF for uplink transmission [73]. Infrared (IR) indicates the light with a wavelength less than red light. It has a frequency range between 300 GHz and 430 THz. IR band is unlicensed and has the potential to provide high-speed connectivity. Since the frequency is above 300 GHz, it cannot penetrate objects, hence used mostly in the indoor LOS environment. According to Boucouvalas et al. [65], IR can achieve up to 1 Gbits/s of data rate over a distance of several meters. IR communication can take place in defused mode, also called scatter mode. In this type of communication transmitter and receiver do not need to be in the line of sight (LOS). However, for such communications devices need to be close to each other which can be an issue when used for developing indoor wireless networks. Researchers are now taking particular interests in using IR to complement VLC network in the uplink transmission.\n\nAlresheedi et al. [74] have proposed fast adaptive beam steering IR (FABS-IR) system to enhance the received optical power signal, speed up the adaptation process and reduce the channel delay during high data rate operation. The proposed scheme employs IR for uplink transmission and VLC for the downlink transmission. FABS-IR was coupled with imaging receivers to improve the system performance. Results showed that employing the IR-VLC network increases the data rate up to 2.5 Gb/s for a mobile scenario in an indoor environment. Quintana et al. [75] have proposed a VLC-IR system for internet access to passengers on flights. The VLC-IR system can also be used to provide personalised entertainment using wireless media without interfering with airline radio systems. The proposed system claims to have minimal interference as every lamp serves as VAP dedicated to each seat. Experiments have shown significant minimisation in transmission error for a short distance (2 m), good downlink signal strength for receivers, and functional capability to work in the presence of other illumination sources. Further, the proposed system is tested for other onboard entertainment such as collaborative games and live video streaming.\n\nFew researchers have investigated IR for uplink transmission in the VLC as compared to WiFi. WiFi is already available, and it has hardware and software support available, whereas integrating IR in experiments are difficult due to less support of hardware and software. IR has less data rate and a lower range of communication, which made it less attractive for the researcher to investigate. Furthermore, IR transceiver has to be integrated into the VAP and in the user device, which further increases the complexity of the VLC system. Nevertheless, researcher community has shown a high interest in improving the IR-VLC in an indoor communication system for specific applications such as in-flight communication system, point-to-point communication. IR communication could be one of the areas, which would complement VLC either in the uplink or during mobility.\n\n\nPLC-VLC\n\nFor VLC to provide a fully functional indoor network, it requires connectivity among VAPs and external networks. The easy and straightforward solution is to connect VAP via separate cables. However, this will increase the cost of cabling, installation, labour and design. PLC utilises the already installed electrical power lines for broadband access [76]. PLC modems are typically plugged into power sockets to provide the interface between data and power network. For over a decade, PLC has been successfully used to transmit radio programs, home automation (remote control of lighting and appliances), home networking, internet access, utility company control switching and automated meter reading [77,78]. Thus like VLC, PLC has the advantage of having the readily available infrastructure.\n\nHu et al. [79] proposed PLiFi, a Hybrid WiFi-VLC that promises low-cost connectivity to the internet, interconnectivity between the VAPs and seamless integration of WiFi for the uplink transmission. The user mobility and change in device orientation is investigated. A smaller and distributed VAP along with a MAC protocol coordinated multi-point transmission (CoMP) is proposed to address the co-channel interference due to adjacent LEDs. In the experimental setup, PLC modems were used to synchronise VAPs.\n\nNdjiongue et al. [80] have developed a cascaded PLC and VLC channel model of hybrid PLC-VLC systems. The influence of PLC channel and VLC transmitters on the propagation of the signal is analysed. The available channel frequency response is used to determine the transfer function to characterise the channels over time. The cascaded channel path of PLC-VLC can have many sources of impairments including but not limited to attenuation and impulsive noise. The proposed model claims to analyse the cascaded channel attenuations accurately. However, noise is ignored in their analysis which can be a source of impairment in the PLC-VLC environment.\n\nYan et al. [81] have performed experiments with three-LED lamps to form a single frequency network (SFN) that showed the feasibility of VLC and PLC hybrid system for the indoor environment. Their system promises high-speed communication and greater signal coverage with less modification to the existing infrastructure. A similar experiment is performed by song et al. [82]. They have implemented a full duplex decode and forward (DF) hybrid PLC-VLC system with minimal protocols or medium modifications. A data rate of 5 Mbps was demonstrated with their experimental test bed, which can be extended theoretically up to 30 Mbps.\n\nThe research work as mentioned above provides some theoretical models as well as some practical implementations for setting up a PLC-VLC hybrid system. It provides an investigation into some essential components of hybrid systems such as channel modelling, noise removal, interference mitigation, and basic networking. However, hybrid systems are not evaluated for their benefits such as energy efficiency and scalability. The cost of electrical devices (e.g., PLC modems) is much higher compared to VAP, and the effect of adding these devices to the system have been ignored. According to Tonello et al. [57] data rates of up to 1 GB are possible by careful analysis of the PLC channel and appropriate selection of modulation schemes. For the current data requirements, 1 Gbps would suffice. However, VLC is capable of providing a data rate of up to 15 Gb/s [30], which is far higher than PLC. Thus, it would lead to a bottleneck. Future network application would require a backbone network that can support higher data rates. A viable solution might be to connect VAP through fibre optic, which will increase the system cost. Such VAP would potentially provide an ultra-high data rate for specific applications, where a user wants an ultra-high data rate.\n\nIn [83] optical fibre link has been used to connect central station (CS) to radio access points (RAP) for indoor applications. The system consists of an RF front-end which includes among other components, an antenna operating in 2.4 GHz, a power amplifier and a photodiode (as a receiver).\n\nIn [84] Gomez et al. have designed a fibre-wireless-fibre (FWF) link for indoor optical wireless communications. Through simulation data rates of 416 and 208 Gb/s can be achieved with a wide field of view of 40 and 60 degrees, respectively. Although these data rates are for the fibre optic communication to avoid the signal conversation from optic to electrical and vice versa. However, the same concept can be extended to the backbone access network of the VLC network to remove the bottle neck of PLC network.\n\n\nLED-to-LED System\n\nA typical VLC system uses LED as transmitter and photodetector as a receiver. Most of the research work has experimented with one-way VLC system in the downlink direction. To take full advantage of the large unregulated bandwidth of VLC, ideally, a bidirectional VLC system should be used for downlink and uplink communication. To build a two-way VLC-VLC system, an LED transmitter and photodetector would be required at both ends for downlink and uplink transmission. However, because of user device sensitivity to orientation changes and aesthetically not pleasing, it has not attracted much research for indoor wireless communication.\n\nSchmid et al. [85,86] have developed a LED-to-LED VLC system based on the concept of Dietz et al. [87]. The VLC system is based on a single LED, which can be used both for transmission and reception. The discharging characteristic of LED was used for receiving the incoming light, which in turn translates to information. The LED capacitance changes with the intensity of receiving light. A threshold was set based on the experiments to determine the discharging for the different intensity of light to infer the incoming symbols of ON and OFF. In another reported work, smart phone was used to relay the VLC to a toy car [88]. The obvious drawback is that LED is less sensitive to light. A high-intensity light would be needed which will increase the cost and decrease the communication range. Also, a single LED for transmission and reception means that it would require multiplexing. Furthermore, fine tuning would be required to keep the LED illuminated without transmitting any useful information. This would decrease the maximum achievable data rate.\n\nWang et al. [58] have proposed a full fibre integrated LED-to-LED VLC system. A fiber optic link is used to connect all VAP's to address the backbone bottleneck. A hybrid access protocol is designed using frequency division multiplexing for the uplink and downlink in fiber transmission, and time division multiplexing for bidirectional VLC transmission. Total system throughput of 8 Gb/s was achieved for eight VAP; each offered a 500 Mbps downlink and uplink transmission. The same network architecture can be extended to support upto 100 Gb/s wireless access system in the future.\n\nLi et al. [89] have proposed a system which uses LED enabled devices to communicate on a two-way VLC channel without the use of an exclusive photodetector, while simultaneously providing illumination. Manchester coding with on/off keying (OOK) modulation is employed to achieve the best tradeoff between illumination and data rates. A prototype is developed to achieve data rates in the order of kbps at a distance of ten of centimetres.\n\nYeh et al. have used 682 nm visible-vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) for the bidirectional VLC system [90]. The downstream of the proposed system is based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulation. To further enhance bandwidth efficiency bit-loading and power-loading algorithms are used. Results show that a single VCSEL bidirectional-VLC system can achieve 10.5 Gbits/s OFDM downstream traffic and 2 Mbits/s upstream.\n\nHeydariaan et al. have investigated the VLC channel at the application level under different settings and scenario for low cost embedded VLC devices [91]. It investigates the effect of platform parameters such as transmitter and receiver position, the nature of receiver (whether the receiver is PD or LED-based), and the protocol level parameters such as symbol rate and frame payload size. The experimental setup involves adopting OpenVLC 1.0 with BeagleBone board and running a Debian Linux. The parameters investigated are throughput and packet reception ratio. Experiments show that channel conditions change for different scenarios and parameters need to be tuned for different scenarios such as day condition, mobility etc. The usage of a simple PD could reduce the impact of ambient light on the overall throughput.\n\nWang et al. [92] have developed a carrier sensing multiple access/collision detection and hidden avoidance (CSMA/CD-H) communication protocol, which provides reliable transmission for VLC networks consisting of nodes with different Field of View (FOV). Hidden node problem arises due to diverse FOVs of LEDs. CSMA/CA-H protocol enables intra frame bidirectional communication in the LED network. The proposed protocol is implemented using an OpenVLC platform consisting of beagleBone Black (BBB) board and a front-end transceiver. Experiments show that the CSMA/CD-H protocol can reduce hidden node collisions significantly while increasing throughput by 50% and 100% for two and four nodes networks respectively.\n\nGiustiniano et al. [93] have addressed the issues of flickers elimination and efficient collision-free medium access control in bidirectional LED-to-LED networks. The system also consists of a method to measure the incoming light during data reception and transmission. Research showed that LED sensitivity, physical rate and flicker elimination are tightly correlated and lead to a tradeoff scenario. The proposed system is evaluated experimentally and shown that it can address flickers eliminations and collision-free communication with a throughput of 780 b/s. The prevailing assumption in the VLC community is that LEDs emit constant light and can provide flicker-free constant throughput. Many of the current deployed LEDs are smart, dynamically adjusting emitted light to ambient conditions. Dynamic change can lead to fluctuating throughput and flickering, resulting in bad user experience and awkward lighting scenarios. Wu et al. have proposed a smartVLC system based upon the investigation of the trade-off between the fine-grained dimming level and high data rate throughput [94]. In order to achieve this trade-off, a new modulation scheme adaptive multiple pulse position modulation (AMPPM) is proposed which multiplexes individual symbols to achieve dimming granularity. Experiments show that an inexpensive smartVLC system provides flicker-free communication up to a distance of 3.5 m with improved throughput.\n\nThese studies have led to the development of very low-cost LED-to-LED VLC systems which can be readily applied is providing connectivity on the very low scale and cater to some specific applications. However, the reliability, scalability and robustness of such VLC based communication networks regarding handling interference, inter/intra LED-to-LED VLC communication and its energy efficiency are still less explored. Nevertheless, a LED-to-LED VLC system would be the end goal to tap into the large chunk of unregulated visible light spectrum. Some point to point applications would be potential applications for a full functional LED-to-LED VLC communications such as vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communication.\n\n\nDiscussion and Open Research Challenges\n\nThere has been increasing innovation in solid-state lighting which has resulted in the availability of efficient and low-cost devices available in the form of LED bulbs. This LED-based lighting infrastructure is now increasingly being used in indoor environments such as homes, offices and shopping malls [63], and in the outdoor environment such as for street and roads lighting [95]. Moreover, it has been shown that LED-based communication (which has been standardised by IEEE as 802.15.7) [33,96] offers higher data rates. According to some researchers, theoretical data rates for LED-based lighting communication is more than 15 Gbps [30]. While this inherent data communication capability is available on the downlink because of the readily available lighting infrastructure and user devices, equipped with photoreceivers and cameras, capable of detecting light. However, using VLC for the uplink has some issues. First, most modern devices do not have the transmitter for VLC and providing new ones will not only add to cost but also increase the device size. Second, using VLC for the uplink results in unusual lighting conditions from a user perspective which are aesthetically not pleasing. To provide seamless integration of VLC, researchers have focused on developing a hybrid system for seamless integration of VLC. In such systems, VLC is used for the downlink transmission and RF or IR for the uplink. Unlike VLC, IR and RF are already supported by most of the current networking devices. RF has a wider coverage range compared to VLC though susceptible to interference. Radio waves can penetrate objects and as a result can be a better substitute for the uplink transmission.\n\nVLC is in the research and development phase. There are many research gaps need to be addressed before its commercial availability for home and enterprise users. Some of the research gaps is discussed as follow.\n\n\nInter-Cell Interference Mitigation\n\nThe small radius of a VAP cell provides higher capacity at the expense of dense deployments. Managing inter and intracell interference is a challenging task in a small and large indoor area, which is equivalent to densification of the cellular network to increase capacity. Visible light spectrum cannot penetrate objects and provides less interference out of its coverage area. However, the VAPs in the same area would cause interference leading to low signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) and would degrade performance [97]. Beysens et al. have exploited dense deployment of LEDs and massive MIMO to propose a system, called DenseVLC [98]. It provides a battery-free VLC networking system by forming different beam spots to serve multiple users simultaneously. Optimisation techniques are used for allocating power among LEDs. DenseVLC prototype consists of 36 Tx and 4 Rx, developed from the commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) devices and powered with the open source OpenVLC platform. The DenseVLC improves system throughput by 45% and the average power efficiency by 2.3 times in comparison with the existing techniques. It also significantly reduces inter-cell interference.\n\nNetwork MIMO, joint transmission and VAP rearrangement are proposed as potential solutions for interference mitigation. In network MIMO and joint transmission, the interfering VAPs can coordinate their transmissions via interference nulling or synchronisation to ensure high SINR at the receivers. Also, interference could be decreased by rearranging the VAPs, which would be similar to cellular planning. However, the systematic design and analysis for optimising the communication performance under the illumination constraints is still an open research challenge which requires further investigation.\n\n\nBackbone Network Design\n\nTo provide broadband access, all VAPs should be connected to the rest of the world. It would be a challenging problem to connect all the VAPs to internet considering the dense deployment for illumination purposes. Creating a new wired network of VAP with Ethernet or fibre is not a cost-effective solution. Wireless connectivity or power line communication could be a potential solution. However, it has limitations such as interference of wireless connections, the low data rate of PLC, the additional cost of integrating with VLC. A potential solution could be to free up the ISM band (2.4 and 5 GHz) providing approximately 200 MHz of a band that could be used to provide backbone connectivity to VAP.\n\n\nUplink Design\n\nMost of the research in the VLC is focused on the downlink transmission to increase the data rate or mitigate interference issues. Less attention is given to uplink transmission from the user device. As mentioned earlier, a limiting factor in using the LED for the uplink from a mobile device is that it consumes not only significant energy but also causes visual disturbance to the user. Researchers propose RF and infrared. However, it would create heterogeneous networks due to different technologies at uplink and downlink. Coordination among multi-home clients, resource allocations and performance issues due to asymmetry heterogeneous networks are in the early phase of research.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this article, we have discussed the visible light communication network, its history and applications. The existing literature is reviewed for the uplink transmission. Currently, most of the research work is focused on the downlink to present a strong argument to the research community about the potential of VLC regarding applications and high data rate. Most of the existing research have used RF and IR for the uplink. PLC is mostly used as a backbone in the access network. We highlighted the limitation of these uplink technologies. In order to efficiently utilise the vast bandwidth of visible light spectrum, a complete system-level evaluation is required. This evaluation should consider the limitation due to uplink and backbone. A scalable, reliable and high data rate VLC network would undoubtedly be a heterogeneous network. This article would facilitate the research community toward the system level analysis and implementation of the VLC system. \n\nFigure 1 .\n1An intelligent transport system using visible light communication (VLC).\n\nFigure 2 .\n2VLC downlink and infrared is used for uplink in VLC Hetnet.

I would not call this a \"cure,\" which I would like to define as a state with stable thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, and triiodothyronine serum concentrations in the normal range in the absence of any thyroid medication. Surgery and radioiodine are unlikely to result in so-defined cures, as their preferable aim as stated in guidelines is to cause permanent hypothyroidism. Discontinuation of antithyroid drugs is followed by 50% recurrences within 4 years; before starting therapy the risk of recurrences can be estimated with the Graves' Recurrent Events After Therapy (GREAT) score. At 20-year follow-up about 62% had developed recurrent hyperthyroidism, 8% had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 3% overt hypothyroidism related to TSH receptor blocking antibodies and thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Only 27% was in remission, and might be considered cured. If the definition of \"cure\" would also include the disappearance of thyroid antibodies in serum, the proportion of cured patients would become even lower.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGraves' disease, can it be cured? A most relevant question for patients diagnosed with Graves' hyperthyroidism, which occurs in a substantial number of subjects as the prevalence in the general population is in the order of 1% to 1.5% [1]. The incidence is 20 to 30 cases per year per 100,000 persons [2,3].\n\nApproximately 3% of women and 0.5% of men develop Graves' disease during their lifetime [2]. Graves' hyperthyroidism is the most common phenotype of Graves' disease; the other phenotypes Graves' orbitopathy (GO) and Graves' dermopathy (local myedema) are relatively rare and not taken into consider-ation in the following discussion on cure.\n\nThe natural history of Graves' hyperthyroidism is not well known. The main reason for this deficiency in our knowledge is that nowadays all patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism are treated in order to restore euthyroidism. Effective therapy with antithyroid drugs (ATDs) or radioactive iodine (RAI) has been available since the end of the Second World War, but even in the first half of the twentieth century patients could be successfully treated with thyroidectomy (Tx). Based on the older literature, attempts have been made to describe the natural history of Graves' hyperthyroidism [4]. Most patients (estimated 60% to 70%) follow an undulating course with alternating hyperthyroid Copyright © 2019 Korean Endocrine Society and euthyroid episodes (Fig. 1, blue line). A minority (about 30% to 40%) experiences just one hyperthyroid episode (Fig. 1, green line). In some patients (not more than 10%) hyperthyroidism never remits and it is thought that in this group with perpetual hyperthyroidism the disease can be fatal if left untreated ( Fig. 1, red line).\n\nWe can influence the course of Graves' hyperthyroidism by Tx, RAI, or ATD. Do these interventions really change the natural course of Graves' hyperthyroidism? Is the disease cured after a successful intervention?\n\n\nTHYROIDECTOMY\n\nIf surgery is chosen for Graves' hyperthyroidism, current guidelines recommend total thyroidectomy (TTx) as the procedure of choice rather than subtotal thyroidectomy (STTx) [5,6]. TTx has a nearly 0% risk of recurrence, whereas STTx may have an 8% chance of persistence or recurrence of hyperthyroidism at 5 years [7][8][9]. Serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs) rapidly decrease during the first 9 months after TTx but are still detected in 18% 3 years later [10]. One may conclude that TTx is capable to definitively cure the hyperthyroid state, but at the expense of creating another diseasehypothyroidism.\n\nThe above does not exclude the possibility to maintain a longterm remission of Graves' hyperthyroidism after STTx. A recent study enrolled 415 consecutive patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism who underwent bilateral STTx (n=385) or the Dunhill procedure (hemithyroidectomy+subtotal resection) (n=57) [11].\n\nMedian postoperative follow-up was 6 years. Persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism occurred in 29%. Thyroid remnant weight was on average 5.1 g, and appeared to be an independent risk factor for persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism (hazard ratio, 1.32). Hypothyroidism developed in over 50% of patients. Only 19% of patients remained euthyroid, and the rate did not increase significantly as thyroid remnant weight increased. This last finding does not support a recommendation done in the past to adjust the remnant size to the thyroid peroxidase or microsomal antibody (TPO-Ab) concentration in order to achieve the greatest likelihood of a postoperative euthyroid state: remnant size should be about 3 cm 3 at low TPO-Ab concentrations but around 5 cm 3 in case of high TPO-Ab levels [12]. It follows that STTx with the intent to maintain a euthyroid state, is not an optimal surgical strategy because the persistence or recurrence rate of Graves' hyperthyroidism is high and the euthyroid rate is low.\n\n\nRADIOACTIVE IODINE\n\nAmerican Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines stipulate the goal of RAI therapy (like that of surgery) in Graves' disease is to control hyperthyroidism by rendering the patient hypothyroid [5]. RAI is very effective provided a sufficient radiation dose is delivered in the thyroid. This can be done equally well by a fixed activity of 131 I or by a calculated activity based on thyroid size and thyroid 131 I uptake [5]. Balancing rapid relief of hyperthyroidism and postponing hypothyroidism appears to be an elusive goal. No dose calculation can secure long-term euthyroidism [6]. Many centers therefore have given up meticulous dose calculation and use fixed doses of 131 I (e.g., 185, 370, or 555 MBq).\n\nA recent study evaluating the use of an ablative RAI dose in 576 Graves' patients reports that 1 year after the first fixed 131 I dose of 400 MBq, 17% was still hyperthyroid, 77% hypothyroid, and 6% euthyroid [13]. At 80-month follow-up, 81 patients had received a second dose and eight patients a third dose; 3.2% was still hyperthyroid (but controlled by ATD or Tx), 86.4% hypothyroid, 3.3% euthyroid, and 6.4% had died; no data in 0.7%. Persistent thyrotoxicosis after the first RAI dose was associated with higher free thyroxine (FT4) at diagnosis, higher pre-treatment thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies, and post-radioiodine treatment with ATD. New GO after RAI developed in 7.3%. RAI-associated GO is most likely related to a steep increase in TSH receptor antibodies in the first 6 months after RAI, with a slow decrease thereafter: 3 years after RAI, TSI are still positive in 60% of patients [10,14]. Worsening or Hyperthyroidism Euthyroid Hypothyroidism Time Fig. 1. Hypothetical curves reflecting the natural history of Graves' hyperthyroidism. A minority of patients (green line) have a single episode of hyperthyroidism. The majority (blue line) has a prolonged course following a relapsing and remitting course over many years. In some patients (red line) the disease never remits but continues to express herself clinically. In the long-term the natural course along the green and blue curves could evolve towards spontaneous development of hypothyroidism.\n\nwww.e-enm.org 31 development of GO occurs more often after RAI than after treatment with ATD (38% vs. 19%; relative risk, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.7) as evident from two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) [15]. Hypothyroidism developed in 95% after RAI, but euthyroidism was not achieved by any participant [15]. One can conclude that elimination of Graves' hyperthyroidism can be reached by RAI (although often a second or sometimes a third dose of 131 I is required), but at the expense of a substantial risk of worsening or developing GO and creating a new disease-hypothyroidism. To replace one disease (hyperthyroidism) by another disease (hypothyroidism) and call that a \"cure\" of the original disease, seems odd. I would call a disease to be cured if, due to the spontaneous course of the disease or due to specific interventions, after a certain period of time nothing can be found any longer-be it clinical signs and symptoms or biochemical and radiological changes-attributable to that disease. In this context it is interesting to note the definition of remission in Graves' hyperthyroidism. In most studies remission is defined as normal serum TSH, FT4, and triiodothyronine (T3) serum concentrations lasting for 1 year without any treatment. But in a recent Australian study, remission was defined as euthyroidism or hypothyroidism after 12 months, and it was reported that 79% of patients achieved \"remission\" with a single dose of 131 I [16].\n\nRAI therapy might be considered problematic because of the need for lifelong levothyroxine replacement if the goal is to render the patient hypothyroid. A personalized dosimetric approach delayed the long-term onset of hypothyroidism in 26% of patients by using much lower administered activities than currently recommended [17]. An interesting RCT in China evaluated the feasibility of 131 I therapy aiming at restoration of euthyroidism without the development of hypothyroidism [18]; realization of this goal would come closer to a \"cure\" of Graves' hyperthyroidism. Eligible patients were randomized into five groups of about 100 patients each. Patients received a range of varying 131 I dosages depending on (1) group allocation: 0.37, 1.11, 1.85, 2.56, and 3.33 MBq/g thyroid tissue was given in group 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively; (2) clinical score: the score evaluated six items (each scored as 0, 1, or 2) about thyroid gland consistency, duration of disease, previous ATD treatment, severity of disease, complications, and age; the score ranges from 0 to 12, and 0.37 MBq/g was added for every 2 scores. Thus e.g., in group 3 the basic activity unit was 1.85 MBq/g and the therapeutic 131 I activity remained 1.85 MBq/g at clinical score of 0, but increased to 4.07 MBq/g at a clinical score of 12 (1.85 MBq+6×0.37 MBq). In doing so one could compare the effect of various 131 I dosages between homogeneous groups as patient characteristics did not differ between the five groups. The optimal outcome (highest proportion of euthyroidism and lowest proportion of hypothyroidism) was obtained in group 3 (average administered activity 261±162 MBq): at 12 year, 72% maintained euthyroidism, 6% remained hyperthyroid, and 22% became hypothyroid. Over the 12-year period, the total recurrence rate was 13.6% [17]. Whether this scheme is preferable to the intentional induction of permanent hypothyroidism recommended by ATA guidelines, remains doubtful.\n\n\nANTITHYROID DRUGS\n\nThe third option in the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism is ATDs. ATD have always been the treatment of choice for uncomplicated cases in Europe and Japan, but RAI was the favourite treatment modality in the USA. A 2011 survey reported ATD were preferred by 86% in Europe and 40% in North America, whereas RAI was preferred by 13% in Europe and 59% in the USA [19]. This has changed dramatically in the USA in the last decade, and now ATD appear the most common treatment in the USA used in 58% of patients followed by RAI in 35% [20]. The reason for this shift away from RAI towards ATD might be the realization that RAI is associated with a definite risk for developing or worsening of thyroid eye disease [14,15]. Could it be that this shift towards ATD is also related to a greater chance of \"cure\" of Graves' hyperthyroidism after ATD than after RAI?\n\n\nBefore starting antithyroid drugs\n\nTo know before starting ATD the likelihood of remission after completing a course of ATD, would be very relevant for selecting the most appropriate treatment modality in a particular patient. If the chance of remission is low, Tx or RAI might be a better option for that patient. Factors associated with a low remission rate as suggested in many but not all studies, are male sex, young age (<40 years), smoking, severe hyperthyroidism, high concentrations of thyrotropin binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBIIs), large goiter size, and the presence of GO [21,22]. However, the predictive value of each of these risk factors is too low for accurate assessment of the remission chance before starting ATD in the individual patient. A recent prospective study was able to construct a predictive score by combining a number of independent risk factors. This so-called Graves' Recurrent Events After Therapy (GREAT) score provides a reasonable prediction of recurrent Graves' hyperthyroidism after Copyright © 2019 Korean Endocrine Society an 18-months course of ATD [23]. The GREAT score takes into account four baseline characteristics, which are already assessed routinely in the work-up of every patient with Graves' hyperthyroidism: age, FT4, TBII, and goiter size (Table 1) [5,6]. Patients in whom the GREAT score falls in class I, have a rather high chance on remission (84%), and ATD would be a reasonable option. In contrast, chance on remission is rather low in GREAT score class III (32%), and Tx or RAI might be preferred. Chance on remission (56%) or recurrence (44%) is about even in patients falling in GREAT score class II; in these patients adding the results of genotyping (human leukocyte antigen subtypes DQB1-02, DQA1-05, DRB1-03, and PTPN22 C/T) generates the GREAT + score which has a greater predictive value and may change management in 38% of patients [23]. The predictive value of the GREAT score has subsequently been validated by two other independent studies [24,25]. Its accuracy might possibly be enhanced by replacing TBII by an assay which more specifically measures TSH receptor stimulating antibodies [26,27]. It is also foreseen that the predictive value of the GREAT + score (which incorporates genotyping) could be enhanced by adding more genotypes related to Graves' disease (like CTLA-4 G/G and TSHR) [28,29].\n\n\nFirst course of antithyroid drugs\n\nA single course of ATD induces remission of Graves' hyperthyroidism in about 50% of cases [3,21,30]. Remission rates vary greatly, however, from 30% up to 70% in individual studies. Remission rates are only weakly related to the duration of ATD treatment: 12 to 18 months seems optimal, with slightly higher recurrence rates after 6 months and no apparent additional benefit by extending therapy beyond 18 months [21]. Remission rates do not differ between the titration method (in which the ATD dose is adjusted according to laboratory results) or the block-and-replace method (in which the relatively high ATD starting dose is maintained and levothyroxine is added when euthyroidism has been reached) [31,32]. Excessive iodine intake does not influence remission rates in iodine-replete areas [33]. The mechanisms by which ATD induce a remission, are not completely understood. It might be related to direct effects of ATD on intrathyroidal T-cells [34], but indirect effects on the immune system by restoration of the euthyroid state might play a role as well [35].\n\nAttempts to enhance remission rates so far failed. Administration of levothyroxine after discontinuation of ATD seemed to increase remission rate [36], but subsequent studies could not confirm the initially promising results and this particular treat- www.e-enm.org 33 ment modality is not used any longer [37,38]. Likewise, adding selenium to ATD did increase remission rate in a pilot study [39], but not in a subsequent placebo-controlled RCT [40].\n\n\nSecond course of antithyroid drugs\n\nIt is thought unlikely that patients with recurrent Graves' hyperthyroidism would go into remission after a second course of ATD, and guidelines therefore recommend definitive treatment by RAI or Tx in case of recurrences. But the last American and European guidelines mention that a second course of ATD might be considered [5,6]. In one study from China a second course of ATD lasting for 15 to 20 months resulted in 76% remissions at a follow-up of 4 years [41]. A Korean study demonstrated similar remission and relapse rates between the first and second course of ATD with 10-year remission rates of 34% and 25% respectively, whereas 10-year remission rates were progressively lower after the third and fourth course of ATD (17% and 13%, respectively) [42].\n\n\nLong-term treatment with antithyroid drugs\n\nIf TBII is negative at the end of 12 to 18 months of ATD therapy, it is reasonable to discontinue ATD as chance on remission is relatively high. Remission chance is relatively low in the presence of high TSH receptor antibody levels at the end of ATD therapy, a condition sometimes referred to as persistent hyperthyroidism although serum thyroid hormones are normal [6]. It reflects the notion that Graves' hyperthyroidism is not really cured as long as TSH receptor antibodies are present, and I quite agree with this line of thinking. Current guidelines acknowledge the feasibility of continuing ATD for a further 12 months if TBII is still high, or to proceed with long-term use of ATD (usually a low dose of methimazole) [5,6]. This strategy has been employed specifically in patients with co-existent GO. In a Dutch study ATD were discontinued after a median treatment duration of 3.5 years (range, 2 to 11): during a median follow-up period of 5 years (range, 1 to 14) recurrent Graves' hyperthyroidism occurred in 37% (easily managed with 131 I), without a relapse of GO [43]. Long-term treatment with a lowdose of methimazole (5 mg/day, n=101) or propylthiouracil (200 mg/day, n=7) for a median duration of 6.7 years in patients with co-existent severe GO, is reported from Denmark: 90% maintained euthyroidism during treatment, and the remaining 10% experienced relapse of hyperthyroidism either spontaneously or after ATD dose reduction [44]. TSH receptor antibodies gradually disappeared from serum in most patients. The only serious side effect of ATD was vasculitis occurring after 6 years of PTU in a 48-year-old woman [44]. A meta-analysis of six studies in which Graves' hyperthyroidism had been treated with ATD for ≥2 years, finds a remission rate of 57%, and a complication rate of 19% (major complications only in 1.5%) [45].\n\nSmoking had a significant lowering effect on remission rate. In a study from Iran patients who had failed to achieve remission on ATD, were randomized into either RAI or further ATD therapy: 10-year outcomes were almost similar with regard to expenses, but hypothyroid episodes were more frequent after RAI than during ATD [46]. A nonrandomized study from Brazil also compared RAI with prolonged low-dose methimazole treatment in patients with recurrent Graves' hyperthyroidism after a course of ATD: RAI was associated with worsening of GO, more weight gain, and more often hypothyroidism at a followup of 5 years [47].\n\n\nLong-term outcome after initial remission on antithyroid drugs\n\nThe long-term outcome of stable remissions is less well known. We have to rely on studies performed in the 1970s and 1980s, when sensitive TSH assays were not yet available and a single TSH measurement could not discriminate between suppressed and normal TSH values. Consequently the TSH response to TRH was often used. Combining the results of three studies, 170 patients were assembled who were in stable remission for more than 10 years [48][49][50]. Euthyroidism was observed in 60%, subclinical hyperthyroidism in 16%, subclinical hypothyroidism in 18%, and hypothyroidism in 6% (Table 2). In one of these studies thyroid histology was available in eight euthyroid patients in longstanding remission: six of them had chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis like in Hashimoto thyroiditis, and none showed diffuse epithelial hyperplasia like in Graves' disease [50]. In the same study, microsomal antibodies (TPO-Ab) had been measured in 22 patients at the time of discontinuation ATD and 10 years later; TPO-Ab were positive in 59% and 91% respectively [50]. Another paper investigated 26 patients who developed hypothyroidism 0.5 to 10 years after discontinuation of ATD therapy [51]. Histology showed chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis in eight patients (fibrous variant in three of them) and partial epithelial hyperplasia in one patient. Microsomal antibodies (TPO-Ab) were present in all, TSH blocking antibodies in 33% and thyroid stimulating antibodies in 66%. TSH blocking antibodies may account for approximately 33% and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis for 66% of these hypothyroid cases [51]. The presence of TPO-Ab is apparently related to the late development of hypothyroidism in Graves' disease, Copyright © 2019 Korean Endocrine Society which comes as no surprise as TPO-Ab is a well-known risk factor for the development of auto-immune hypothyroidism [52]. It is of interest that the presence of TPO-Ab on the other hand seems to protect against recurrent Graves' hyperthyroidism. One hundred and seventeen patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism were treated with ATD for 2 years and then followed for on average 2.5 years; they were divided in group 1 (no thyroglobulin antibody [Tg-Ab] and no TPO-Ab), group 2 (no Tg-Ab but positive TPO-Ab), and group 3 (positive Tg-Ab and positive TPO-Ab) before and during ATD therapy. Relapse rates in the three groups were 39%, 27%, and 11% respectively [53]. A more recent study likewise reports that baseline TPO-Ab is inversely associated with relapse rates in a dose-dependent manner [54]. The data suggest patients with TPO-Ab are least likely to relapse, but more likely to proceed to hypothyroidism. However, other studies did not find TPO-Ab measurements useful for prediction of remissions or recurrences [55,56].\n\nThe perplexing conclusion of very long-term follow-up studies in Graves' patients in stable remission is that 40% have still abnormal thyroid function, related to the persistence of thyroid antibodies ( Table 2). In 16% there exists subclinical hyperthyroidism, most likely due to the persistence of TSH receptor stimulating antibodies. In 24% there exists subclinical or overt hypothyroidism, related to either TSH receptor blocking antibodies or TPO-Abs. Interestingly, many patients in this group also have persistent TSH receptor stimulating antibodies. It illustrates again how the interplay between destructive/inhibitory and stimulatory immunological effector mechanisms determines the outcome of thyroid function in autoimmune diseases [57]. The co-existence of TSH receptor stimulating and blocking antibodies is of particular pathophysiological interest. Remissions of Graves' hyperthyroidism are caused by a decrease of TSH re-ceptor stimulating antibodies, but can an increase in TSH receptor blocking antibodies contribute to remissions? Alternating hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism in Graves' disease has indeed been linked to switches between TSH receptor stimulating and blocking antibodies [58]. Can hypothyroidism induced by TSH receptor blocking antibodies still be called Graves' disease? Have hypothyroid patients with both TSH receptor blocking antibodies and TPO-Abs two simultaneous diseases, Graves' disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis? Or do they belong to one and the same disease entity, namely autoimmune thyroid disease? Apart from these semantical issues, it is clear that Graves' hyperthyroidism cannot be called really cured in the presence of still abnormal thyroid function.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWhether or not Graves' hyperthyroidism can be cured, depends on the definition of 'cure.' If cure is defined as just disappearance of thyroid hormone excess, then cure is possible in almost all cases by either Tx, RAI, or ATD. Cure defined as 'restitutio ad integrum' implies maintenance of the euthyroid state like it was before the illness, that is without any medication and without thyroid antibodies in the circulation. Guidelines state the aim of Tx or RAI in Graves' hyperthyroidism should be permanent hypothyroidism, which requires lifelong levothyroxine medication for maintaining euthyroidism. Creating another disease in order to treat the original disease, is no cure. ATDs leave open the possibility of cure, defined as maintenance of the euthyroid state (normal TSH, FT4, and T3) without the use of any medication.\n\nThe average remission rate after a course of ATD is about 50% [21]. Most recurrences occur within 4 years after discon- www.e-enm.org 35 tinuation of ATD [3]. Although prognosis is excellent after 4 years without relapse [30], late recurrences do occur and only one in three patients experiences permanent remission [21]. Remission rate after 10 years is in the order of 30% to 40%, and hypothyroidism has developed in 10% to 15% 15 years after ATD [59]. Taken into account the above reviewed literature, permanent cure of Graves' hyperthyroidism is possible albeit at a low rate of about 27% (Fig. 2). The cure rate would be even lower if cure also supposes the absence of TSH receptor antibodies.\n\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.  \n\nFig. 2 .\n2Chance of remission of Graves' hyperthyroidism after a course of antithyroid drugs.

Hafellner.This widespread species had previously been included within Catillaria A.Massal. and Caf/nar/a Vain., but study of the ascus structure of these genera revealed that M. grossa was clearly different, having an ascus with an amyloid tholus penetrated almost completely by a conical to barrel-shaped, non-amyloid axial body (masse axiale).In contrast, Catillaria and Catinaria have asci with a uniformly amyloid tholus, although additional anatomical differences further separate these superficially similar genera.The introduction of a new genus led to the reappraisal of other species included within obviously heterogenous groups such as Catillaria as generally applied in the sense of A. Zahibruckner; that is, essentially crustose lichens with lecideine apothecia and one-septate, hyaline ascospores.Thus, other species were soon added to Megalaria\n\nboth in the family Megalariaceae.More recently, Kalb (2007) segregated the genus Catillochroma Kalb from Megolaria, on the basis of its having a layered excipulum with a prosoplectenchymatous outer layer and an inner layer of interwoven hyphae inspersed with crystals.Two species ofthis genus are represented in the Tasmanian flora and were previously included within Megalaria: C melanotropa (Nyl.)Kalb and C pulverea (Borrer) Kalb.Megalaria is a genus of cool, moist, oceanic climates {Ekman & Tonsberg 1996).It appears to be well represented in cool temperate areas of the Southern Hemisphere, where it occurs chiefly as a wet forest epiphyte, but also on rocks, soil, wood and bark in other vegetation types.Two taxa from Campbell Island were described recentlybyFryday (2004a), whereas Galloway (2007) deals with 11 taxa from New Zealand (some of which are now placed in Catillochroma).Collections of Megalaria are well represented in Australian herbaria, usually under a variety of 'dust-bin' names such as Catillaria, and a glance at the early Australian lichen literature indicates that several species of the genus have been described in the past (under Lecidea, Patellaria, Catillaria and other genera).To unscramble this plethora of names and collections will require a long and demanding study.The aim of the present paper is more limited in focus, being to ascribe names to three of the more common and widespread species that are frequently cited in the course of Tasmanian floristic, ecological or conservation studies, and to account for some of the older names in the literature that have fallen into disuse.\n\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nThe Study is based on specimens collected by the author and housed in the Tasmanian Herbarium (HO), with some duplicates distributed to BM, CANB, GZU and herb.Vezda.Anatomical investigations were conducted on hand-cut sections of thalli and apothecia mounted in water, 10% KOH (K), Lugol's iodine, concentrated HNO3 (N) and concentrated HCI (H).Measurements of ascospores are based on 100-200 observations each and are presented in the format: lowest value-me^in-highest value.Chemical constituents were examined by thinlayer chromatography using standard methods (Orange efa/.2001 ).Terminology for apothecial pigments and the procedures for their identification and characterisation follows Meyer and Printzen (2000).Nomenclature of ascus types follows generally acceptable accounts (e.g.Hafellner 1984, Purvis ef a/.1992).Taxonomy 1. Megalaria laureri (Th.Fr.)Hafellner, in P.L. Nimis, The Lichens of Italy: 429 (1993).\n\nThallus crustose, effuse to patchy, smooth to rather unevenly warty, or composed of tiny, scattered granules to c 0.2 mm wide, whitish grey, lacking isidia or soredia, ecorticate, mostly delimited by a black prothallus; photobiont a unicellular green alga with cells globose, 6-14 pm diam.Apothecia to 0.9 mm diam., scattered or in irregular clusters of 2-3, superficial, highly basally constricted to sometimes almost subpedicellate; disc plane at first, later convex, matt, black or rarely brown-black, epruinose; margin concolorous with the disc, persistent but sometimes obscured in oldest, most convex apothecia.Excipulum in section 60-80 pm thick, composed of radiating, branched and anastomosing, conglutinated hyphae 1.5-2 pm thick, at the outer edge with a thin, ±discontinuous band of grey-green to blackish green pigment, Ktintensifying greenish, N+ crimson, within with a dilute to very concentrated purple-pink pigment, intensifying in K, N-f pale orange, extending beneath and subtending the hymenium and hypothecium.Hypothecium 40-100 pm thick, not inspersed with oil droplets, purplebrown to purple-pink, K+ intensifying pink, N+ pale orange above, dilute greenish grey, K±intensifying green, N+ crimson below.Hymenium 70-90 pm thick, not inspersed, mostly hyaline but overlain with a continuous or patchy layer to c. 20 pm thick of blackish green and purple-pink pigments (as in the excipulum).Chemistry: no substances detected by t.I.c.Remarks: Megalaria laureri was first recorded for Tasmania by Wetmore (1963) on the basis of a dubious statement by Almborn (1948), and has been maintained in various checklists since (e.g.Kantvilas 1994, McCarthy 2008).However, no Tasmanian specimens of the species have been available for study until now, and it is likely that the concept of the species employed by Almborn (1948) is different to that in use today.The record from Queensland (McCarthy 2008) cannot be confirmed.\n\nThisspeciesisrecognisedbythedistinctive pigments in its excipulum, hypothecium and epihymenium.The dominant, purple-pink pigment approximates'atra-red' of Meyer and Printzen (2000); this intensifies pinkish in K, is tunchanged in H and reacts N+ orange.Also present in the epihymenium and the hypothecium is 'cinereorufa-green': K±green intensifying, H±bluegreen, N+ crimson.In very occasional sections, a thin band of 'hypnorum-blue' may also be present in the upper part of the hypothecium; K+ turquoise, H±violet-blue, unchanged in N. The pigments may occur in discrete patches or overlay each other, so their detection is not always straightforward.Although all these pigments may also occur in other species of Megalaria to some degree, the predominance of the 'atra-red'pigment is highly characteristic.\n\nAdditional descriptive data for this species are given by Coppins (1992) (for Great Britain, under Catillario) and by Brodo ef al. (2001) {for North America).Whereas Tasmanian specimens have the same pigments and general habit, their ascospores are relatively longer and broader [cf.12-18 x 5-7 pm (Coppins 1992); 13-18(-24) X 5-7(-8) pm (Brodo etal. 2001) Thallus crustose, 50-100{-150) pm thick, generally smooth, effuse and continuous, sometimes cracked, abraded, rather gnarled and scurfy, whitish cream, glaucous grey to pale brownish, not delimited, lacking isidia or soredia, ecorticate; photobiont a unicellular green alga with cells globose, 7-10(-16) pm diam.Apothecia 0.8-1 (-1.5) mm diam., scattered, superficial, basally constricted; disc plane at first, later convex, matt, typically jet-black but sometimes pale greyish, brown or piebald, epruinose; margin persistent except in oldest, most convex apothecia, often rather glossy, typically concolorous with the disc, or darker when the disc is pale, rarely a little brownish at the sides.\n\nExcipulum in section 40-80 pm thick, composed of radiating, branched and anastomosing, conglutinated hyphae to c. 2 pm thick, with a grey-green, olive-green to bluish green, K±intensifying greenish, N-f crimson pigment at the edge, sometimes extending within in of Mega/ar/a.These differ clearly by their ascospore size, but are superficially indistinguishable, both having jetblack, glossy apothecia with a persistent margin, and a thin to moderately thick, whitish thallus; they also have identical apothecial pigmentation.One of the taxa is identical to M. melaloma whereas the other is the species described below as M. s ubtasmanica Kantvilas.\n\nUnfortunately it seems inappropriate to retain the epithet 'tasmanica'for the latter, even though it is the better represented of the two lichens in this specimen: the original description of C tasmanica (Rasanen 1944) explicitly gives the spore measurements as 26-30 x 12-14 pm, indicating that the author was intending to describe what is now recognised as M. melaloma.\n\nRodway's Patellaea scutata was described as a nonlichenised fungus (Rodway 1925).The type specimen is a particularly abundant and well-developed collection of M. melaloma.The greenish pigmentation found in the epithecium and excipulum approximates 'cinereorufa-green' of Meyer and Printzen (2000); it reacts N+ crimson-red, H-J-blue-green and intensifies greenish in K.Although the appearance of the pigment in section varies from an almost blackish green to a quite dilute pale greenish or with hints of olive or brown, these variations appear to be due to concentration alone.Sometimes the pigment may appear to have quite strong turquoisebluish tones, but nevertheless reacts the same in K, H and N.In some specimens, additional dilute tinges of a pinkish or purple-brown pigment may also be present.\n\nbut in this taxon, it does not appear to be of taxonomic significance.This pigment approximates 'atra-red' (Meyer & Printzen 2000) and reacts N+ orange, but is ±unchanged in K and H.\n\nThe thallus chemistry of the species is ambiguous.Some specimens, especially those with a thicker, paler thallus, contain trace amounts of atranorin, but this compound has a sporadic occurrence in many crustose lichens and especially those growing in exposed, well-lit conditions.\n\nThallus chemistry does not appear to be a useful character in Megalaria taxonomy in general (Ekman & Tonsberg 1996), with the exception of those taxa recently transferred to the genus CatHlochroma by Kalb (2007).Ekman and Tonsberg (1996) discuss the variation in ascus structure between M. grossa (the type species of the genus) and other taxa included in Megalaria or, currently, the related genus Catillochroma.In M. melaloma and the other species treated in the present paper {M.loureri and M. subtasmanica), the ascus approximates the Biatora-type.There is a well-developed, amyloid tholus almost completely penetrated by a conical masse axiale with an acute apex.Using very dilute Lugol's solution after pretreatment with K, a narrow, more intensely amyloid zone is evident adjacent to the masse axiale, although the internal differentiation of the tholus can be difficult to discern.The ocular chamber is relatively short and blunt to ±absent (see Figs 2A-C).Remarks: Given the abundance of this taxon in herbarium collections, and its conspicuous nature in the field, it is surprising that no existing name could be found in the literature.Even more remarkable is the fact that its sympatric look-alike, M. melaloma, has been described previously no fewer than four times.\n\nThese two taxa share a ±smooth thallus and identical apothecial pigmentation, dominated by 'cinereorufagreen'with traces of'atra-red' (Meyer & Printzen 2000).\n\nA particularly notable character is the chiefly hyaline excipulum and hypothecium that, together with the pigment, separate these species from most other species of the genus.Megalaria subtasmanico and M. melaloma differ from each other by their ascospore size.In the former, the asci are correspondingly larger and the hymenium taller.The size character is consistent and has been confirmed in several hundred observations spanning scores of apothecial sections and specimens.In both species, the asci approximate the Biatora-type (see under M. melaloma) (Fig. 2).\n\nDistribution and ecology: Megalaria subtasmanico is a common epiphyte of cool temperate rainforest and wet eucalypt forest.It colonises understorey trees and shrubs, including those with smooth bark (e.g.Acacia, Pomaderris), fibrous bark (members of the Asteraceae) and papery bark (Myrtaceae).Like M. melaloma, with which it frequently occurs in closely intermixed colonies (to the extent that most herbarium collections of these species are usually mixed), it is a member of a rich assemblage of foliose and crustose lichens.\n\nThe species is known at present from Tasmania, King Island and the south-west of Western Australia, but it can be expected to be more widespread.\n\n\n\nAsci 8-5pored, clavate, 60-85 x 14-22 pm, with a well developed amyloid tholus penetrated almost entirely by a conical masse axiale bordered by a narrow, more Intensely amyloid zone (i.e.approximating the S/oforo-type); ocular chamber usually not developed.Paraphyses (ax in K, simple or occasionally branched and anastomosing, 1-2 pm wide; apices capitate, 4-5 pm wide, persistently conglutinated with epihymenial pigments (as above).Ascospores ellipsoid to ovate, 1-septate, {15-)16-79.6-24(-26)x 7-S.6-10 pm.Pycnidia not observed.Figs. 1 A, 2A.\n\n\nFigure 1 .\n1\nFigure 1.Comparison of ascospores of Megalaria species.A: M. laureri {Kantvilas 91/87);

Thus the identification oftheTasmanian specimens is provisional at this stage.Distribution and ecology: Megalaria laureri is widespread albeit often localised in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere.It appears to be uncommon in Tasmania where it is known from only two collections: one from the trunk of Banksia In wet eucalypt forest and the other from a young trunk of Nothofagus cunninghamii (Hook.)Oerst. in cool temperate rainforest.Specimens examined: TASMANIA.Yarlington Tier, 42°32'S 147°18'E, 620 m alt,, 8.xi.l987,G.

Weymouth, has not been located, despite extensive searches of likely herbaria(Kantvilas 1988).However, the description (Shirley 1894) matches M. melaloma perfectly, and that taxon occurs in great abundance at the same locality today.Remarks: Megaloria melaloma is characterised by the generally smooth, crustose thallus, the epruinose, usually jet-black apothecia with concolorous disc and margin, the essentially hyaline or at most dilutely pigmented excipulum and hypothecium, the predominance of greenish pigments in the epithecium and excipulum, the eight-spored asci and the relatively small ascospores.The last two characters separate M. melaloma from M. subtasmonica (see below), which has distinctly larger ascospores (mostly 30-44 x 12-20 pm) that occur 2-6 per ascus.The lack of opaque, essentially blackish green pigments in the hypothecium and excipulum distinguish it from several other species, including the common and cosmopolitan M. grossa, which is widespread in Tasmania and mainland Australia.Megalaria species in general are well characterised by their thallus morphology, apothecial pigmentation and ascospore size, characters that are usually cited in even the briefest of published descriptions.No other known taxa appear to combine the same characters as does M. melaloma, although the existence of some older, as yet overlooked published name for such a common and conspicuous species cannot be discounted.Thus, further synonyms may well come to light as investigations of the early collections of Australasian lichens continue.\n\n\n\n\nDistribution and ecology: Megalaria melaloma is a common and widespread epiphyte in a wide range of wet forest types, including Nothofagus-dorr\\\\nated cool temperate rainforests and fuca/ypfus-dominated sclerophyll forests.Although apparently preferring hosts with smooth bark (for example Acacia, Atherosperma, Pittosporum, Pomoderris), it may also occur on more fibrous substrata such as on Bedfordio or species of Myrtaceae.Rarely it has been found on rocks or charcoal.It is typically a component of a rich association of crustose and small follose lichens, including Thelotrema lepadinum (Ach.)Ach., and species of Parmelia,Pertusaria and Mycoblastus.Also commonly present in such lichen communities are several species with a superficially similar appearance to M. melaloma (i.e. with a whitish crustose thallus and black, lecideine apothecia), including Megalaria subtasmanica Kantvilas, Bacidia wellingtonii (Stirt.)DJ.Galloway, Sarrameana albidoplumbea (Hook.f.& Taylor) Farkas and Hafellia species; to distinguish these lichens unequivocally requires microscopic examination of apothecial sections and squashes.Specimens studied are from Tasmania, Victoria, the A.CT. and New South Wales, indicating a south-eastern Australian distribution.Apothecialo 1 (-1.3)mm diam., scattered, superficial, basally constricted; disc plane to convex, matt, usually jet-black, occasionally dark brown, brown-grey or ±piebald, epruinose; margin typically concolorous with the disc, persistent, often somewhat glossy.Excipulum in section 60-120 pm thick, composed of radiating, anastomosing, highly gelatinised hyphae 1-1.5 pm thick, mostly hyaline within, but with patchy dilute pigments, especially towards the outer edge and adjacent to the hymenium; pigment mostly greygreen, olive-brown to blue-green, K±unchanged or intensifying greenish, N+ crimson, sometimes also with a purple-brown to pinkish pigment, ±unchanged in K, N-t-pale orange.Hypothecium to 200 pm thick, occasionally inspersed with oil droplets, typically hyaline to dilute straw-coloured and K-i-weakly yellowish, sometimes with a subhymenial upper band to C.80 pm thick, pigmented greenish or olive brownish (as in the excipulum).Hymenium 120-160 pm thick, not or only very rarely inspersed with scattered oil droplets, hyaline but overlain by a continuous to patchy epihymenial layer 10-15 pm thick of olive-green to blackish green pigment, Klintensifying greenish, N+ crimson (as in the excipulum).Asci elongate-clavate, at first 8-spored but typically with a few spores soon aborted and therefore generally (2-)4-6-spored, 110-140 X 26-42 pm (very few intact asci observed), with a well-developed amyloid tholus penetrated ±entirely by a conical masse axiale and bordered by a narrow, more intensely amyloid zone (i.e.±of the B/atora-type); ocular chamber not developed.Paraphyses lax in K, simple to very sparsely branched, 1-2 pm thick; apices usually neither pigmented nor swollen, sometimes expanded to 3-4 pm and distinctly greenish.Ascospores ellipsoid to ovate, sometimes fabiform, (24-)30-35./-44(-46)x 12-/4.6-20(-21)pm.Pycnidia not observed.Chemistry: atranorin detected occasionally by t.l.c.Etymology: The specific epithet refers to the close similarity of the new species with Catillaria tasmonica (= Megalariamelaloma), the name that has been frequently misapplied to the species in Tasmanian literature.\n\nMuelleria\nVol 26(2) 2008\nm alt., 15.V.1987, G.

We investigated if (1) GCs express the IR in cancer cells (CC-IR) and vasculature (VIR), (2) IR expression is clinically relevant and may be a novel target of GC treatment. Methods 467 primary GCs were studied by immunohistochemistry using an IR-specific antibody. CD31-immunostaining ensured the presence of representative intratumoral microvasculature. VIR, and membranous and cytoplasmic CC-IR (mCC-IR, cCC-IR) were evaluated using a modified HistoScore (HScore) and subsequently dichotomized into low or high IR expressions. The IR status was correlated with clinico-pathological patient characteristics, including survival and HER2 status. Results VIR, mCC-IR, and cCC-IR (HScore > 0) were found in 97.0%, 87.6%, and 95.7% of all GCs. After dichotomization of the HScores, 50.7, 48.8, and 50.3% were classified as VIR-high, mCC-IR-high, and cCC-IR-high, respectively. IR was associated with the Laurén phenotype, tumor localization, local tumor growth, vascular invasion, perineural invasion, tumor budding, mucin phenotype, UICC stage, worse survival, and the HER2 status. On multivariate analysis, VIR status was an independent prognosticator of overall (p = 0.010) and tumor-specific (p = 0.006) patient survival. Conclusions VIR and CC-IR expressions are frequent in GC, biologically significant and even correlate with the HER2 status, opening avenues for novel putative therapeutic interventions in GC.Publisher's Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\nBackground\n\nThe hallmarks of cancer enclose six biological capabilities, i.e., sustained proliferative signaling, evasion of growth suppressors, resistance to cell death, replicative immortality, angiogenesis, and activation of invasion and metastasis. In 2011, Hanahan and Weinberg amended their hallmarks and added, e.g., reprogramming of energy metabolism [1]. Metabolic reprogramming could also be regarded as an underlying concept in gastric cancer (GC) [2]: one cornerstone of metabolic reprogramming comprises an increased glucose uptake and metabolism in cancer cells [2], which is utilized in PET imaging [3]. Barely studied for GC until now, metabolic reprogramming also involves an altered expression of the insulin receptor (IR).\n\nThe IR is a transmembrane receptor of the receptor tyrosine class, which is located at the cell surface and in cytoplasmic vesicles. It co-governs energy regulation and stimulates proliferation [4]. The two isoforms of the IR convey different functionalities: metabolic effects are exerted via isoform B (IR-B) [4]. IR-B preferentially binds insulin. The isoform A (IR-A) is overexpressed in cancer, and provides mitogenic and proliferative effects [4]. The IR-A binds insulin and IGF-II. An increased expression of the IR in cancer cells (CC-IR) has been described in renal, colorectal, breast, lung, thyroid, and ovarian cancers [4]: interestingly, in renal cancer, CC-IR was found to be associated with a prolonged disease-free and overall survival [5]. In breast cancer, the correlation between CC-IR and patient survival led to opposing results [6,7]. In non-small cell lung cancer, the expression of IR in tumor cells was associated with poor patient outcome [8].\n\nIn this study, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) GCs express the IR in tumor cells (CC-IR) and tumor vasculature (VIR). (2) The expression of the IR is biologically relevant and may provide a novel target of GC treatment.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nStudy population and histology\n\nFrom the archive of the Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, we sought all patients who had undergone either total or partial gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophago-gastric junction between 1997 and 2009. All tissue samples originated from routine therapeutic surgeries, for all of which the patients had given written informed consent. Ethical approval was obtained from the local ethical review board (D 453/10 and D 468/17) of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany, which permitted us to use the samples from those patients who had also given written informed consent for a prospective scientific use of their patient material. All patient data were pseudonymized after study inclusion. The following patient characteristics were retrieved: type of surgery, age at diagnosis, gender, tumor size, tumor localization, tumor type, depth of invasion, number of lymph nodes resected, and number of lymph nodes with metastases. Patients were included if an adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophago-gastric junction was histologically confirmed. Exclusion criteria were defined as (1) histology identified a tumor type other than adenocarcinoma, and (2) patients had undergone a perioperative or neoadjuvant chemo-or radiotherapy. Each resected specimen had undergone gross sectioning and histological examination by trained and board-certified surgical pathologists. Date of patient death and cause of death were obtained from the Epidemiological Cancer Registry of the state of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, thereby distinguishing between tumor-related deaths and deaths from other causes. Follow-up data of those patients who were still alive were retrieved from hospital records and general practitioners.\n\n\nHistology\n\nTissue specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Deparaffinized sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological re-examination of primary tissue sections was carried out for all cases to assure if inclusion criteria were met. Tumors were classified according to the Laurén classification [9] and re-examined by two surgical pathologists. pTNM stage of all study patients was determined according to the 8th edition of the UICC guidelines [10].\n\n\nTumor budding\n\nTumor budding was assessed on H&E-stained specimens, following the recommendations of the International Tumor Budding Consensus [11], which defined budding as \"a single tumor cell or a cell cluster of up to 4 tumor cells\" [11]. For each patient sample, the H&E slide with the most pronounced tumor budding at the invasion front was identified. Within the chosen slide, ten separate fields were screened using a 10× objective, to identify the tumor budding \"hotspot\". Employing the \"hotspot\" approach, tumor buds were counted within one field of a \"hotspot\" area using a 20× objective lens with a 23 mm eyepiece field number diameter. The tumor bud count was normalized by the factor 1.323 to correspond the standardized field area of 0.785 mm 2 . Tumor budding was evaluated as being absent (Bd0; 0 buds), 1-4 buds (Bd1), 5-9 buds (Bd2), and ≥ 10 buds (Bd3) per standardized field area. Similar to Kemi et al. [12], we then categorized tumor budding into three groups, i.e., no (Bd0; 0 buds), low (Bd1 and Bd2; < 10 buds) and high tumor budding (Bd3; ≥ 10 buds). We added the Bd0 (no buds) group, which is not part of the International Tumor Budding Consensus, as we consider it as an own group.\n\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nImmunohistochemistry was carried out with monoclonal antibodies directed against CD31 (dilution 1:100; mouse monoclonal antibody; JC70; Cell Marque, California, USA), mucin 2 (dilution 1:100; mouse monoclonal antibody; clone Ccp58; Novocastra; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), mucin 5 (dilution 1:100; mouse monoclonal antibody; clone 45M1; Thermo Scientific, Schwerte, Germany), and CD10 (dilution 1:10; mouse monoclonal antibody; clone 56C6; Novocastra; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).\n\nImmunostaining was performed with the autostainer Bond™ Max System (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany): Antigen retrieval was done with ER1 (citrate buffer Bond pH 6.0; CD10), or ER2 (EDTAbuffer Bond pH 9.0; CD31, mucin 2) according to the manufacturer`s instructions. The mucin 5 immunostaining did not necessitate any antigen retrieval. The immunoreaction was visualized with the Bond™ Polymer Refine Detection Kit (DS 9800; brown labeling; Novocastra; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).\n\nIR immunostaining was carried out manually using a rabbit monoclonal anti-insulin receptor β-antibody (dilution 1:50; clone 4B8; Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, USA), which detects both insulin receptor isoforms: deparaffinized tissue sections were boiled in EDTA buffer (pH 9.0; 1 min; 125 °C) and then washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), blocked with hydrogen peroxide block (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min, washed with TBS, and then treated with Ultra V Block (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 min. Immunoreactions were visualized with the ImmPRESS reagent peroxidase universal anti-mouse/ rabbit Ig-MP-7500 and the ImmPact NovaRed peroxidase substrate SK-4805 Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, respectively). Immunohistochemistry was followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Negative controls were generated by omitting the primary antibody. Healthy endometrial tissue specimens (proliferative phase) served as positive controls.\n\n\nEvaluation of CD31 and IR immunostaining\n\nThe CD31-immunostaining served to prove the presence of intratumoral vessels, especially the presence of capillaries, within the respective tumor samples. Cancer vessels were defined as capillaries, arterioles, and venules being surrounded by cancer cells.\n\nImmunostaining of the IR was evaluated according to the modified HistoScore (HScore). The first parameter was based on the intensity of the stained cells. A score of 0 (no evidence of staining), 1 + (weak), and 2 + (strong staining reaction) was applied. The second parameter assessed the percentage of cells showing no (0), weak (1+), or strong (2+) immunostaining. In each case, the percentages add up to 100%: a case lacking any expression of IR would be categorized as 100% negative and a case which showed strong immunostaining of half of the tumor cells and no immunostaining of the reminder would be categorized as 50% negative (0) and 50% strongly positive (2+). Using this approach, intratumoral heterogeneity was readily evident. The entire series was screened and three representative cases were selected for the adjustment of IR 0, IR 1+, and IR 2+ staining intensity (Fig. 1). These cases were subsequently used as reference standards for the in-depth evaluation of the entire cohort.\n\nIR immunostaining was evaluated separately for cytoplasmic (cCC-IR) and membranous expression (mCC-IR) in cancer cells, and for endothelial cells of cancer vessels (VIR). Finally, the median HScore served as a cut-off to differentiate between high and low IR expression.\n\n\nAssessment of mucin phenotype\n\nThe classification of the mucin phenotype was done according to Namikawa et al. [13]: \n\n\nAssessment of the HER2 status\n\nThe HER2 status was assessed as previously described [14]. In brief, a monoclonal anti-Her2/neu antibody (clone 4B5 with a Ventana BenchMark XT automated slide staining system, both Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was used for immunohistochemistry: the immunostaining intensity was scored ranging from negative (0) to strong (3+). For all GC cases with an immunostaining of 2+ , a silver-enhanced in situ hybridization was performed (HER2-SISH double-labeling in situ hybridization system; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). If a strong immunostaining (3+) was present in ≥ 10% of the tumor area or a moderate immunostaining (2+) together with an HER2 gene amplification (ratio ≥ 2.0), the sample was classified as HER2 positive.\n\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nSPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analyses. The correlation between non-ordinal clinico-pathological patient characteristics and the VIR status or the CC-IR status was tested with Fisher's exact test. T category, N category, UICC stage, tumor grading, and tumor budding as variables of ordinal scale were tested with Kendall's tau test. Median survival with 95% confidence intervals was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between median survivals were tested with the log-rank test. A multivariate survival analysis (Cox regression) was performed. A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant. All p values are given uncorrected. To compensate false discovery rate within the correlations, we applied the Siemes (Benjamini-Hochberg) procedure. P values having lost significance are marked. Table 1 summarizes the clinico-pathological patient characteristics of the GC cohort. 467 patients fulfilled all study criteria.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nStudy population\n\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nIR expression was studied using whole tissue sections.\n\nA weak cytoplasmic immunostaining of tumor cells (cCC-IR 1+) was found in 431 (92.3%) cases and a strong cytoplasmic (cCC-IR 2+) in 254 (54.4%) cases. Immunonegative tumor cells (cCC-IR 0) were found in 364 (78.0%) cases. The percentage area of the three immunostaining cytoplasmic categories, i.e., cCC-IR 0, 1+, and 2+ ranged from 0 arrow head) insulin receptor staining without immunostaining of cancer cells, b high cytoplasmic (cCC-IR-high, HScore ≥ 90), high vascular (VIR-high, HScore ≥ 115; arrow heads), but low membranous insulin receptor staining (mCC-IR-low, HScore ≤ 40). Examples of c high membranous insulin receptor expression (mCC-IR-high, HScore > 40), but low cytoplasmic insulin receptor expression in tumor cells (cCC-IR-low, HScore < 90) and of d high cytoplasmic insulin receptor expression (cCC-IR-high, HScore ≥ 90), but no membranous insulin receptor expression in tumor cells (mCC-IR-low, HScore ≤ 40). Anti-insulin receptor immunostaining, hematoxylin counterstaining. Original magnification A-F: 400× The median HScore for cCC-IR was 90 (range 0-200) and the cohort was dichotomized into cCC-IR-low (HScore < 90) and cCC-IR-high (≥ 90) (Fig. 1). 232 (49.7%) GCs were cCC-IR-low and 235 (50.3%) GCs cCC-IR-high. With regard to membranous immunostaining (mCC-IR), a weak staining (mCC-IR 1+) was found in 343 (73.4%) and a strong (mCC-IR 2+) in 322 (69.0%) cases. Immunonegative tumor cells (mCC-IR 0) were found in 457 (97.9%) cases. The percentage area of the three immunostaining membranous categories, i.e., mCC-IR 0, 1+, and 2+ ranged from 0 to 100%, and the combination of the staining categories in each individual case varied: 58 (12.4%) GCs were completely devoid of any mCC-IR expression. Two cases showed 100% mCC-IR 2+. 407 cases showed various combinations of two or three staining intensities. The median HScore for mCC-IR was 40 (range 0-200), and the cohort was dichotomized into mCC-IR-low (HScore < 40) and mCC-IR-high (≥ 40) (Fig. 1). 239 (51.2%) GCs were mCC-IR-low and 228 (48.8%) mCC-IR-high.\n\nAll tumor samples contained tumor capillaries as verified by CD31 immunostaining. We found the insulin receptor to be particularly expressed in the capillaries and only to a lesser extent in arterioles or venules. Vascular insulin receptor expression was always restricted to the cancer site and was never found within adjacent non-neoplastic gastric tissue. A weak immunostaining (VIR 1+) was found in 428 (91.6%) and a strong immunolabeling (VIR 2+) in 361 (77.3%) cases. 14 (3.0%) GCs were VIR 0 despite the presence of CD31-positive endothelial cells. The median HScore was 115 (range 0-200). The cohort was dichotomized into VIR-low (HScore < 115) and VIR-high (≥ 115) (Fig. 1). 230 (49.3%) GCs were VIR-low and 237 (50.7%) VIR-high.\n\nCollectively, these data show that the expression (= combination of intensity of immunostaining and amount of immunopositive tumor areas) of cCC-IR, mCC-IR, and VIR is heterogeneous in GC including \"gray-scale\" as well as \"black-and-white\"-immunostaining patterns.\n\n\nCorrelation of insulin receptor expression in cancer cells and vessels\n\nExpression of VIR, cCC-IR, and mCC-IR were positively associated: VIR-high was synchronously observed with cCC-IR-high in 62.0% (p < 0.001) and with mCC-IR-high in 55.3% (p = 0.005). cCC-IR-high and mCC-IR-high were simultaneously seen in 57.0% (p < 0.001).\n\n\nCorrelation of insulin receptor expression in cancer cells (CC-IR) with clinico-pathological patient characteristics\n\nTo explore the putative biological significance of IR expression in GC cells, we correlated cCC-IR and mCC-IR with various clinico-pathological patient characteristics (Table 1). GC patients with cCC-IR-high were significantly older and had more commonly an intestinal or differentiated phenotype of lower tumor grade. Interestingly, cCC-IR also correlated inversely with tumor budding and perineural invasion ( Table 1).\n\nNo other significant associations between either cCC-IR or mCC-IR and clinico-pathological patient characteristics were found.\n\n\nCorrelation of vascular insulin receptor expression (VIR) with clinico-pathological patient characteristics\n\nNext, we explored the putative biological significance of VIR. GCs with VIR-high were significantly more frequently localized at the proximal site and of unclassified phenotype according to Laurén. Interestingly, VIR status also correlated significantly with local tumor growth (T category), UICC stage, vessel invasion (V category), tumor budding, and the mucin phenotype (Table 1).\n\n\nHER2 status and the expression of the insulin receptor in gastric cancer\n\nRecently, it was shown that metformin may improve the prognosis that is associated with diabetes and insulin treatment, mainly in patients with primary HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer [15]. Therefore, we were interested to test the hypothesis that the IR status and the HER2 status are linked in GC. Interestingly, HER2-positive GCs were significantly more commonly cCC-IR-high (p = 0.002) and a trend was seen for mCC-IRhigh (p = 0.073). No correlation was found between HER2 and VIR. Areas of cCC-IR-high and HER2 positivity were observed to overlap within the same tumor samples (Fig. 2).\n\n\nSurvival analysis\n\nThe entire GC collective showed a median overall survival (OS) of 14.1 months and a median tumor-specific survival (TSS) of 15.5 months. Patient prognosis significantly depended on the Laurén phenotype, T, N, M, L, V, Pn, and R categories, UICC stage, lymph-node ratio, tumor budding (data not shown), VIR status, and mCC-IR status (Table 1; Fig. 3). Patients with VIR-high had a lower OS (12.1 months) and TSS (13.4 months) compared with the VIR-low group (OS: 16.7 months; TSS: 19.9 months), which lost significance after multiple testing (Table 1). Similarly, GCs with mCC-IR-high showed a median survival of 12.5 months (OS) and 12.8 months (TSS) compared with 17.3 (OS) and 20.3 months (TSS) of the mCC-IR-low group ( Table 1). The correlation between mCC-IR and TSS remained significant after multiple testing (Table 1; Fig. 3). There was no significant correlation between cCC-IR and patient survival (Table 1). On multivariate analysis (Table 2), the VIR status turned out to be an independent prognosticator of overall (p = 0.010; hazard ratio = 1.355) and tumor-specific (p = 0.006; hazard ratio = 1.429) patient survival.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur analysis of a large cohort shows for the first time that GCs express the IR in tumor cells (CC-IR) and endothelial cells of tumor vessels (VIR) and that both, CC-IR and VIR, are biologically relevant: CC-IR and VIR correlated with various clinico-pathological patient characteristics, including patient survival. VIR turned out to be an independent prognosticator of overall and tumor-specific patient survival on multivariate analysis. Interestingly, cCC-IR also correlated with the HER2 status, pointing towards a link between metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells and HER2.\n\nIR was significantly more frequent in intestinal-type GC than in other GC types, such as determined by the Laurén classification and the mucin phenotype. This finding is in line with observations made previously by applying complex gene expression analyses. Using GC cell lines, Tan et al. [16] proposed two different intrinsic subtypes, an intestinal and a diffuse subtype. Genes up-regulated in the intestinal subtype were related to carbohydrate, protein metabolism, and cell adhesion, whereas cell proliferation and fatty acid metabolism were enriched in the diffuse subtype [16]. The significance of intrinsic subtypes was confirmed later-on by gene expression analyses: intestinal-type GCs more frequently showed the proliferative and metabolic gene signature [17]. The IR-expressing GCs of our collective matched several aspects of the proliferative subtype as described by Lei et al. [17]: the associations of IR expression with lower grading categories and higher patient age parallel the proliferative subtype's features. Furthermore, in the proliferative subtype, RAS signaling and not epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [17] is supposed to be prevalent. This seems to be applicable to the IR-expressing tumor samples of our collective: first, the insulin receptor's proliferative stimuli are known to be conveyed via RAS signaling [4], especially via its mitogenic isoform IR-A. Second, the morphologic manifestation of EMT [11] is considered to be tumor budding. IR expression was associated with low, but not with high tumor budding, thereby further supporting the notion that IR-expressing GCs rather belong to the proliferative than to the mesenchymal GC subtype. Nevertheless, IR expression was more frequent in samples with low than in samples without tumor budding, which might indicate that EMT might still play a limited role in IR-expressing GCs.\n\nThe biological effects of IR were observed to depend on its differential expression in tumor and endothelial cells, which was especially evident with respect to the T category. As VIR was associated with tumor size, we hypothesize that VIR might be involved in neoangiogenesis. This contention is supported by the observation that hypoxia up-regulates IR-expression in bladder cancer [18], and insulin induces endothelial cell tube formation and migration [19]. Against the background of the significantly diminished survival of VIR-high GC patients as demonstrated by our study, we, therefore, hypothesize that this patient group might benefit from IR-targeted therapies. In a translational medical approach, the drug metformin might prove to be useful in exploiting our findings of IR expression in GC.\n\nMetformin is known to exhibit diverse indirect and direct antitumoral effects and influences a multitude of signaling pathways in cancer [20]. It suppresses IR and IGF1-receptor signaling indirectly by the reduction of the circulating ligands insulin and IGF1 and directly by interfering with the receptors' signaling pathways [20]. Metformin has been shown to reduce the risk of developing GC [21,22], to improve survival and to reduce cancer recurrence in GC patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [23]. It would have been important to know the histological IR expression status of these patients, as diabetic hyperinsulinemic conditions are thought to promote cellular proliferation in cancer via the IR [24]. However, a correlation between diabetes mellitus and IR expression in GC has not been performed until now, and our findings of an association between VIR and worse survival in GC might be valid for non-diabetic patients, as well.\n\nIR expression in GC tumor samples was observed to be heterogeneous, which fits to the concept of subclonal diversity in GC. We, therefore, accounted for tumor heterogeneity by applying a histology score, which enabled us to dichotomize between GC with predominantly elevated and GC with predominantly decreased IR expression. Tumor heterogeneity in GC has to be considered, as dominant cancer cell clones will eventually determine the clinical fate of the individual cancer patient-especially in the context of resistance to immunochemotherapy and the management thereof.\n\nIn terms of potential therapeutic implications, the significant correlation between cCC-IR and the HER2 status is highly intriguing: Upon IR stimulation, the activated IR is known to internalize from the cell surface, thereby resulting in cCC-IR [25]. Zhang et al. previously described a link between IR stimulation and resistance of HER2-positive GC against HER2-targeted therapy in vitro [26]. We, therefore, hypothesize that especially cCC-IR-positive GC patients with concomitant HER2 positivity might represent a new patient group, which could particularly benefit from metformin treatment. Highly encouraging in this respect are auxiliary findings in breast cancer: diabetic HER2-positive hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients on metformin medication had an improved outcome under anti-HER2 therapy in a clinical trial [27] and in a retrospective study even without any specific anti-HER2 treatment [15]. The authors suspect an involvement of the IR/IGF1-receptor axis [15].\n\nSumming up, we show that VIR and CC-IR are frequently expressed in GC. The expression is biologically significant and even correlates with the HER2 status, opening avenues for novel putative therapeutic interventions in GC.\n\nFunding The study was financed by the Institute of Pathology of the Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Germany.\n\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\n\nConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\nHuman rights statement All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and later versions.

The maximum possible HScore was 200, if all cells of a given tumor sample showed a strong staining: [0 × 0%] + [1 × 0%] + [2 × 100%] = 200. The multipliers within the formula yield an improved stratification of the HScores: tumor samples with a predominantly high staining intensity and such samples with a predominantly low staining intensity are more distinctively separated by the HScores.\n\n\nWe distinguished the gastric (MUC5+ , CD10−, MUC2−), intestinal (MUC5−, CD10+ , MUC2± or MUC5−, CD10−, MUC2+), combined (MUC5+, CD10+, MUC2± or MUC5+ , CD10−, MUC2+), and unclassified type (MUC5−, CD10−, MUC2−).\n\nFig. 1\n1Expression of the insulin receptor in gastric cancer.

To investigate the correlation between the level of serum β-catenin and the disease progression of colorectal polyp (CRP) and colorectal cancer (CRC) and find its potential diagnostic value. Methods. A total of 327 clinical serum samples and their electronic medical records were collected. Detecting by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the correlations of serum β-catenin with tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CRC clinicopathological parameters and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were analyzed. Results. Serum β-catenin levels in the CRP and CRC patients were significantly higher than those in the healthy control (HC) group (P < 0:05 and P < 0:001). Compared with CRP, serum β-catenin level in CRC was also increased (P < 0:05). However, there was no significant difference in gender, age, location, tumor size, Dukes staging, or metastasis (P > 0:05) between serum β-catenin and clinical parameters of CRC. There was no correlation between serum β-catenin levels and CEA in CRC patients (P = 0:14). ROC curve analysis showed that serum β-catenin possessed the maximum diagnostic efficiency in CRP (AUC = 0:73, P < 0:05) with 86.41% sensitivity and 51.56% specificity. β-Catenin combined with CEA had the highest diagnostic efficiency (AUC = 0:88, P < 0:05) with 81.88% sensitivity and 73.44% specificity. With CRC patients from CRP patients, ROC analysis of the combining detection (AUC = 0:70, P < 0:05) had the 70% sensitivity and 84.5% specificity. Conclusion. The serum β-catenin levels are gradually increased in CRP and CRC, while there is no correlation between its levels and CRC disease process. Single serum β-catenin or combined CEA would be one of the potential candidate biomarkers for colorectal disease diagnosis.\n\nIntroduction\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the digestive system [1]. Globally, it is third in morbidity and fourth in mortality [2]. It becomes a large burden in the world. CRC is a multistage process, which is that healthy colonic epithelium could slowly develop into polyps or adenomas and then into carcinomas over 20-40 years [3,4]. Current methods for clinical diagnosis of colorectal cancer include stool tests, colonoscopy [5], and colonography (MRI and CT) [6,7]. However, stool tests have their limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity [8], while colonoscopy needs for the higher tolerance of patients and colonography needs for appropriate bowel preparation. Extensive efforts have been made in the past and are currently underway for the development of molecular markers in CRC. These molecular markers should be unique, noninvasive, safe, and affordable with high sensitivity and specificity [9]. To facilitate better clinical decision-making, many researchers work on finding out which biomarker can detect CRC at an early stage, like nucleic acids, lipid, proteins, and tumor cells [10][11][12]. But so far, little success has been achieved in this area, and searching for a noninvasive serum tumor marker with high sensitivity and specificity is still needed.\n\nWingless-related integration site (Wnt)/β-catenin signaling pathway is a conserved pathway mediating the tumorigenesis and embryogenesis [13], especially in the procession of CRC [14,15]. Wnt signaling regulates signal transduction by controlling the levels of β-catenin through phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation [9]. The earliest and most prevalent genetic event in colorectal tumorigenesis is the mutation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene [16]. Inactivation of APC leads to the disassembling of the βcatenin destruction complexes (Axin, GSK3β, and APC) and then the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus [17]. In the past, many efforts mainly focused on the accumulation of nucleus β-catenin in CRC cells, which initiates the transcription of many target genes that related to proliferation and invasion and then leads to tumorigenesis [18].\n\nRecent studies have found that β-catenin can be detected in human serum, and its level is related to the development of hepatitis C-related liver cancer, hepatitis B-related diseases, type 2 diabetes, PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, and early-onset ulcerative colitis [19][20][21][22][23]. Given that there is a hyperactivated Wnt/β-catenin signal in CRC and a large amount of β-catenin aggregation in intracellular and nucleus, the level of serum β-catenin in CRC patients and related clinical significance are still unclear. Therefore, our research detected the level of serum β-catenin in CRP and CRC to analyze the potential role in disease diagnosis.\n\n\nMaterials and Method\n\n2.1. Patients and Sample Collection. The serum samples (n = 327) were recruited from the Second affiliated hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January 2015 to March 2018. The samples were divided into three groups, CRC group (n = 160), CRP group (n = 103), and normal healthy subjects with no history of CRC or CRP disease group (n = 64). CRC group included 86 males and 74 females: 95 patients below the age of 60 years and 65 patients beyond 60 years old. According to the tumor size, 78 cases of the tumors were less than 3 cm and 82 cases were over 3 cm. According to tumor location, 83 cases were with colon tumors and 77 cases were with rectal tumors. According to the Dukes staging system, colorectal tumors were divided into stages A, B, C, and D. 81 cases were in A+B stage, and 79 cases were in C+D stage. There were 95 cases of nonmetastasis and 65 cases of lymphatic metastasis in CRC patients ( Table 1). All the patients had no other tumors and severe organic diseases. All the volunteers, with informed consent, took 4 mL of blood through the peripheral vein on an empty stomach. The serum with non-anticoagulation treatment was sealed and numbered and then stored at -80°C for testing. Eight pairs of fresh CRC tissues and matching distal normal tissues and five CRP tissues were collected from patients who had undergone colorectal resection at the First Affiliated Hospital of the Chongqing Medical University. The patients received no chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiother-apy before surgery, and written informed consent was received from all participants. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee for human studies at Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China (protocol number 2012-09). All the procedures were following the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n2.2. ELISA. The serum β-catenin level in all samples was measured by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ELISA) (CUSABIO, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The CEA values were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay \"ECLIA\".\n\n2.3. Immunocytochemistry Staining (IHC). This experiment was detected according to Wu et al.'s method [24], briefly described in the following: firstly, the tissues were formalin-fixed and then paraffin-embedded. The sections from the tissues were deparaffinized and dehydrated. They were boiled for 10 min in 0.01 M citrate buffer and incubated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) in methanol for 15 min to block endogenous peroxidase. The sections were then incubated with the anti-β-catenin polyclonal antibody (1 : 300 dilution; sc-7199, Santa Cruz) overnight at 4°C, following incubation with secondary antibody tagged with the peroxidase enzyme (SP-9000, Zhongshan Golden Bridge, China) for 30 min at room temperature, and were visualized with 0.05% 3,3-diamino-benzidine tetrachloride (DAB) till the desired brown reaction product was obtained. The sections were finally counterstained with hematoxylin. Control sections were performed using phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) without a primary antibody. All the slides were observed under a Nikon E400 Light microscope, and representative images were taken.\n\n\nStatistical Analyses.\n\nAll the data were processed with SPASS 20.0 software. The difference between serum βcatenin and CEA level in CRP and CRC patients and HC was analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The relationship between serum β-catenin and clinical pathological parameters of CRC was analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. The ROC curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of serum β-catenin, CEA, and \"β-catenin+CEA\" in samples. The correlation between serum β-catenin and CEA level was estimated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The statistical differences are presented at probability levels of P < 0:05 ( * ), P < 0:01 ( * * ), and P < 0:001 ( * * * ), indicating that the difference was statistically significant.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe Differential Expression Level Analysis of Serum β-\n\nCatenin in HC, CRP, and CRC Groups. We performed IHC staining to detect the expression of β-catenin in sections of eight pairs of samples (CRC and matching distal normal tissues) and five CRP samples. Expression levels of β-catenin were significantly higher from either CRC or CRP tissues than from HCs. Of note, its expression was higher in CRC tissues than that in CRP tissues (Figure 1(a)). Further, the serum β-catenin level in the CRP group (21:81 ± 13:37, pg/mL) and CRC group (32:13 ± 20:53, pg/mL) was higher than that in the HC group (12:85 ± 13:78, pg/mL). The difference was statistically significant (P < 0:05 and P < 0:001, Figure 1(b)). Simultaneously, the serum β-catenin level of CRC group (32:13 ± 20:53, pg/mL) was higher than that of the CRP group (21:81 ± 13:37, pg/mL) (P < 0:05, Figure 1(b)). These results showed that the level of β-catenin gradually increases during the processing of the development from CRP to CRC. These results were shown in Table 2.\n\n\nThe Correlation between the Expression Level of Serum β-\n\n3.3. The Correlation between the Expression of CEA and Serum β-Catenin Level in Colorectal Cancer. As a relatively better diagnostic marker for CRC, does CEA have any correlation with serum β-catenin? We used the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay \"ECLIA\" technique to detect the CEA level in the collected samples. We found that the CEA level in the CRC group (14:27 ± 26μg/L) is significantly higher than that in the CRP group (7:13 ± 7:52μg/L) and the HC group (4:34 ± 4:98μg/L) (P < 0:05, Figure 2(a)). The CRP group showed no level of statistical difference (P > 0:05, Figure 2(a)) with the HC group. No correlation was shown between serum β-catenin level and serum CEV level in CRC patients (r = 0:04, P > 0:05) by Spearman's rank correlation analysis (Figure 2(b)).\n\n\nThe Clinical Diagnosis Value of Serum β-Catenin\n\nLevel in CRP and CRC. As the level of serum β-catenin increases gradually during the processing of the development from CRP to CRC, does it have any diagnostic value in the process of the disease and would be a better diagnostic value when combining with CEA value which is the existing marker? We divided these indicators into three groups in this section, followed as a β-catenin group, CEA group, and β-catenin +CEA group. The diagnostic efficacy of these groups was analyzed using the ROC curves. When CRP occurs, the AUC in serum β-catenin group, CEA group, and β-catenin+CEA group were 0.74, 0.59, and 0.73, respectively. It suggested that serum β-catenin has the highest diagnostic efficacy. The sensitivity of serum β-catenin is 86.41%, and the specificity is 51.56% (Figure 3(a)). When CRC occurs, the AUC in serum β-catenin group, CEA group, and β-catenin+CEA group were 0.80, 0.67, and 0.88, respectively. It suggested that β-catenin combined with CEA has the highest diagnostic efficacy. The sensitivity of combined β-catenin and CEA was 81.88%, and the specificity was 73.44% (Figure 3(b)). When CRP developed to CRP, the AUC in serum β-catenin group, CEA group, and β-catenin+CEA group were 0.64, 0.59, and 0.70, respectively. It suggested that the diagnostic efficacy of combined β-catenin and CEA was comparatively high. The sensitivity of β-catenin combined with CEA is 70%, and the specificity is 84.5% (Figure 3(c)). These results suggest that the combination of serum β-catenin and/or CEA level has better diagnostic potential in the process of CRP, even in the process of CRC disease.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nColorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors that threaten human health [25]. Although the improved living standards and the changes of lifestyles and dietary patterns, the incidence of colorectal cancer is still increasing [21]. Compared with fecal excretion examination, colorectal examination, CT colon imaging examination, or MRI examination methods, the serum tumor biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer are convenient material extraction, small trauma, high reproducibility, and lower cost of detection. Therefore, serum cancer biomarkers have become a hot spot for tumor diagnosis and detection. Single serum β-catenin or combined CEA has a better diagnostic value of CRP and CRC. It would be one of the potential candidate biomarkers for colorectal disease diagnosis.\n\nThe sample in the peripheral blood includes circulating tumor cells (CTC); cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which includes circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA), which includes not only some small RNAs but also mRNAs; circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs); proteins; and metabolites [26]. ctDNA could accumulate in the blood stream due to the release of ctDNA from dying tumor cells during necrosis or apoptosis. Under normal conditions, the innate immune system timely clears the cell breakdown products, thus staying in low concentration in the blood stream. In tumors, rapid cell turnover results in accumulation of cell products, including ctDNA which often is not accessible to phagocytes [26]. Those methods to look for evidence of cancer circulating in the blood could be defined as liquid biopsy. The use of ctDNA and CTCs as an alternative screening tool for CRC is under investigation. A study found that the ctDNA was positive in 73% in localized CRC and levels of ctDNA correlated with disease stage, thus suggesting that ctDNA can be used both in localized disease and metastatic CRC [27]. Three cases of DNA-gene mutations (CDKN2A, TP53, and KRAS) were observed 4 years prior to CRC formation [28]. Especially, KRAS mutant fragments were detected in the blood of patients with KRAS-mutant colorectal tumors, with high specificity (99.2%) and sensitivity (87.2%) [29]. During a median follow-up time of 9.2 person-years, the DNA aneuploidy of 53 patients (total 245 patients) was found which was estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves [30]. Thus, DNA aneuploidy also might predict the CRC formation. However, several decades devoted to elevate ctDNA levels in the circulation of patients with cancer. The quantity of ctDNA and CTCs detected has been shown to correlate with tumor burden and enables assessment of heterogeneity. That means plasma often contains low levels of ctDNA in early or localized disease, which becomes a big challenge for the use of liquid biopsy as a screening tool.\n\nβ-Catenin is a crucial component of the Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling pathway. High expression of β-catenin is considered a sign of aberrant β-catenin signaling pathway activation and is thought to promote tumor progression [31], especially CRC progression [32]. The start signals for the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway were  Wnt proteins, which bind to the frizzled (Fz) receptors and coreceptor LRP on the cell membrane [33,34]. The absence of Wnt ligands caused the phosphorylation of β-catenin.\n\nThe phosphorylated β-catenin fails to bind and disperse the components of the degraded complex. Thus, the β-catenin cannot be degraded, resulting in the accumulation of βcatenin in cells [13,35]. This theory could support a new and effective therapy of colorectal cancer, that is, using a certain molecular substance which could attenuate the Wnt signaling pathway to inhibit cell growth and tumor growth. Studies on β-catenin mainly involved in the accumulation in the cell and the transcription of the target gene into the nucleus, leading to tumorigenesis [18,[36][37][38]. Recently, a small number of cases have confirmed that β-catenin can be detected in serum and might have a certain relationship with the course of hepatitis C, hepatitis B, type 2 diabetes, PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, and early-onset ulcerative colitis [19][20][21][22][23]. These findings suggested that β-catenin might be used as a marker for serum disease-associated markers. Many studies focused on the initiation of target genes in the cell by β-catenin into the nucleus, but neglected that it may itself be a cytokine that can be secreted outside the extracellular. As a multifunctional protein molecule, βcatenin can also be combined with E-cadherin to mediate cell adhesion. Under normal circumstances, β-catenin is abundantly located on the cell membrane, while in the stages of tumor disease, EMT phenomenon is often accompanied by a decrease in E-cadherin [39]. Thus, it is suspected that the reduction in E-cadherin may result in the inability of β-catenin to bind and release into the extracellular space. However, this hypothesis needs to be further confirmed. This study showed that the serum β-catenin level in CRP and CRC patients was significantly higher than that in healthy controls. The serum β-catenin level of the CRC patients was also significantly increased compared with that of the CRP group. These results indicated that the serum βcatenin level tends to increase gradually in the process of colorectal polyps or colorectal cancer. To explore the relationship between serum β-catenin and CRC disease progression, we grouped these cases according to the factors, e.g., gender, age, tumor size, tumor location, metastasis, and Dukes staging. We found that the level of serum β-catenin in CRC patients was not associated with these pathological parameters. Therefore, when the serum β-catenin level of CRC patients is elevated, we can only reasonably suspect the possibility of early development for CRC, but could not estimate the stage of the disease.\n\nFurthermore, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a common cancer biomarker. It is a high molecular weight glycoprotein found in embryonic tissues and colorectal malignancies. High CEA levels are associated with tumorigenesis. Many tumorigeneses in human were found in the increase of serum CEA level, and it is better for efficacy judgment, disease development, detection, and pretreatment for colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer [40][41][42][43]. Investigators have found that ctDNA in combination with CEA is a potentially useful tool for the diagnosis of early-stage colorectal cancer [27]. The increase of CEA level in primary CRC patients has been confirmed [44]. However, CEA is not specific for CRC and can be elevated in pancreaticobiliary disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and other malignancies [45,46]. Thus, we also conducted a correlation study between the serum β-catenin level and the CEA level. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient analysis showed no correlation between the two factors. This phenomenon might be due to the limitations of CEA, which had lower specificity and sensitivity. It is difficult to capture the changes in the early stages of the tumor, and β-catenin may change at an earlier stage.\n\nFinally, we used the ROC curves to assess the diagnostic value of serum β-catenin in the process of CRP to CRC disease. The results showed that serum β-catenin had the highest diagnostic efficacy in the diagnosis of CRP (AUC = 0:74). In the evaluation of CRC, β-catenin combined with CEA had the highest diagnostic efficacy (AUC = 0:88). Also, we evaluated the detection efficiency of CRC in CRP, which determined by β-catenin combined with CEA. The AUC was 0.70. These results demonstrated that serum β-catenin level could detect changes in early colorectal disease and combined with CEA can improve the diagnostic accuracy of CRC.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nIn sum, CRP and CRC have a significant increase in the level of serum β-catenin. It has little correlation with the disease progression of CRC. While combining the value of CEA, it may improve the accuracy of the early diagnosis of colorectal diseases. The diagnostic performance of CRC is fast and straightforward. Therefore, these studies not only have a role in screening and early detection of disease but are also important for prognosis and to predict response to therapy in CRC, reducing its morbidity and mortality.\n\n\nData Availability\n\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.  \n\nFigure 1 :\n1The differential expression level analysis of serum β-catenin in healthy control (HC), colorectal polyp (CRP), and colorectal cancer (CRC) group.

Given the significant increase in the level of serum β-catenin for CRC patients, does it relate to the process of CRC development? According to the different clinicopathological factors of CRC, we classified 160 CRC patients. First, the relationship between serum β-catenin level and gender, age, and the location was analyzed. We found that the serum β-catenin level in the male group was 33:52 ± 21:28 pg/mL and in the female group was 30:1 ± 19:35 pg/mL. This difference was little statistically significant (P = 0:34). The serum β-catenin level in the group younger than 60 was 30:22 ± 18:51 pg/mL and in the group older than 60 was 34:35 ± 22:57 pg/mL. This difference was not statistically significant (P = 0:34). The serum β-catenin level was 31:45 ± 19:9 pg/mL in the colon tumor group and 32:86 ± 21:25 pg/mL in the rectal tumor group. The difference was little statistically significant (P = 0:76). Also, we analyzed the relationship with essential parameters for the process of CRC disease, like tumor size, Dukes stages, and lymph node metastasis.

Those traditional methods are subjective, where the individual may or may not be answering genuinely to questions. In this paper, the data has been collected using self-report ratings and also using electronic smartwatches. This study aims to develop a weighted average ensemble machine learning model to predict major depressive disorder (MDD) with superior accuracy. The data has been pre-processed and the essential features have been selected using a correlation-based feature selection method. With the selected features, machine learning approaches such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and the proposed Weighted Average Ensemble Model are applied. Further, for assessing the performance of the proposed model, the Area under the Receiver Optimization Characteristic Curves has been used. The results demonstrate that the proposed Weighted Average Ensemble model performs with better accuracy than the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest approaches.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs we live in modern times where computer jobs and fast food chains are used to enhance life, no one is ready to consider exercising or taking time out [1]. With all the stress happening, it is more than typical that the stress comes with anxiety and depression. People these days are confused with what they are doing and do not have a proper vision, which makes them puzzled. In the long term, this can end up in depression [2]. The more dangerous part is that the person may not know they are experiencing depression [3]. The prevailing thought among people is that they should take care of their physical health, but the fact is mental health is just as important as physical health, and in fact, it is more important as anything that affects mental health will eventually affect the physical, too [4]. The reason for Clinical Depression or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is still unknown, but experts say it can be one among the following: substance abuse, tragic stressful events, family history, present health issues, or medications [5]. The symptoms usually include long term sadness, hopelessness, (i) To the best of our knowledge, a Weighted Average Ensemble machine learning model is developed for the first time in this paper detecting Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) using an integrated feature set, and its performance is justified through experimental results. (ii) A unique integrated feature set is formulated by combining the features from the questionnaire, and the smartwatch sensor encompassing a heart rate monitor. (iii) The gathered data is pre-processed to handle the missing values with the help of Mean Imputation, and then the significant features are selected using the Correlation-based Feature Selection technique. (iv) The proposed Weighted Average Ensemble model surpasses the logistic regression, and the random forest approaches in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves measure. (v) It can be observed from the experimental results that the Weighted Average Ensemble model performs better in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and FMeasure in due comparison with Logistic regression and Random Forest Models. Furthermore, the proposed model also illustrates a superior performance with an accuracy of 99.01%.\n\nThe remaining portion of the paper is structured as a Review of Literature, Dataset Description, Methodology, Results and Discussion, and Conclusion.\n\n\nReview of Literature\n\nIt is an arduous task to differentiate between Parkinson's disease's postural re-emergent tremors from essential tremors. So, the authors in this study [22] have used a smartwatch to monitor and record the tremors. They have considered 41 patients for the study, and the recordings were done for an accelerometer from a smartwatch as well as an analog accelerometer in parallel. With the results they got, they concluded that the smartwatch shows more prominence than the analog device. It provides diagnostically accurate and relevant information on postural tremor when compared with other analog methods.\n\nIn newborn babies, it is crucial to find out the Initial Heart Rate [23,24]. The heart rate detection using auscultation of heart and palpation of umbilical cords were found to be inaccurate and unreliable [25]. Also, late, the NRP (Neonatal Resuscitation Program) has recommended using pulse oximetry, but that took a long time to detect the heart rate, and sometimes it is even a failure. Then they came up with ECG, which is faster but expensive. Hence, to overcome these issues, the authors have adopted a smartwatch technique to find out the heart rate of newborn babies, which is accurate and inexpensive.\n\nIn this approach [14], the authors have implemented a machine learning-based approach using the smartwatches for activity recognition. Furthermore, this involves matching activities with a times series sensor from a smartphone or smartwatch. The activities include Walking, Sitting, Jogging, Standing, Climbing, Eating, and many other activities that involve hands and does not involve hands. They have used the WEKA tool for implementing the machine learning models. The algorithms employed are Random Forest, IB3 instance-based, J48 Decision Tree, Multi-Layered Perceptron, and Naïve Bayes. They have compared the performance of the accelerometer and gyroscope of the smartwatch and found out that the accelerometer of the smartwatch performs better than the gyroscope.\n\nFor people with mental disorders such as dementia, it is essential to monitor patients to ensure whether they are performing the proper exercise and the necessary amount of sunlight. For their health and safety, it is imperative to monitor them continuously. The authors in this study [26] have developed a smartwatch with features such as accelerometer, GPS, and illumination sensor. Moreover, this will help in monitoring patients with dementia. The proposed algorithm effectively identifies the amount of exercise the patients are taking and everything else that is required, and it shows 96% of success with its experimental results.\n\nIn this approach [27], the authors have implemented a machine learning model by gathering sensor data from the electronic smartwatches to predict the alcohol content in blood in real-time. They have also developed an Android application to connect to the sensors and also to store data from the sensor. They have implemented both classification and regression models. For the regression problem, they have used Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Networks, and for the classification problem, they have using Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. They have evaluated their model using RMSE for regression and recall, FMeasure, and Precision for classification. In the end, they found that this problem is tackled effectively if it is considered as a classification problem, and among the two classification algorithms, SVM performed better.\n\nIt is vital to diagnose depression at an early stage in order to treat it. In this approach, the authors [28] have done a non-linear analysis of EEG signals to differentiate depressed patients from healthy individuals. They have considered 45 depressed patients and extracted features from the EEG signals. They have used three machine learning classifiers, such as K-Nearest Neighbour, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Logistic Regression. The results show that the highest classification accuracy is achieved by the Logistic Regression classifier (90%).\n\nThe studies mentioned above are sensor-based and machine learning related approaches applied to various healthcare domains. There are very fewer works on sensor-based approaches along with machine learning applied in classifying or predicting MDD. The major drawback of using the smartwatch sensors is that various factors would affect the sensors and heart rate-monitors of the wearer. The traditional method to diagnose depression is using a questionnaire. However, most of the time, the questionnaire seems to be subjective, whereas the sensors generate objective data, i.e., it requires no effort from the subject. Hence, in this study, we have used the combination of both (sensors and questionnaire) to collect the subjective and objective data and validate the results in classifying the subjects with MDD.\n\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this study, we have used the Mi band-3 smartwatch to detect the behavior and heart rate of the participants in diagnosing MDD. The participants were given a questionnaire to fill every day in the morning for one week. The participants were made to wear the smartwatch all the time for one week including the weekend, even when they are sleeping. The smartwatches can measure the sleep patterns and have the component for continuous heart-rate monitoring. The participants in this study are a combination of male and female, with an average age of 40, weight of 60 kg, and height 176 cm.\n\nThe methodology comprises of three phases: Pre-processing of data, selecting essential features from the data, and applying Machine Learning models individually on the high discriminative features, and also applying the proposed weighted average ensemble machine learning model on the data, then comparing it with the individual implementation of the base models. In this section, we explain the process by which we did the classification. Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of the study. \n\n\nDataset Description\n\nWe have collected data from 500 average aged people who complained about mood swings. We used data from the Questionnaire, Smartwatch, and Heart rate monitor. The data collection involved 500 people, and among the 500 records, we rejected 50 because of technical issues. Together the dataset consists of 35 features, which are later reduced using feature selection techniques. We have used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [29] for the questionnaire and the features from the accelerometer of the smartwatch. All these features are combined after feature selection and then passed through machine learning models.\n\n\nHamilton Depression Rating Scale\n\nHamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) is the most widely used self-rating report for assessing depression. The questionnaire consists of 21 items to rate the severity of depression. Among the 21 items, 17 are severity measures for the depression while the remaining four are symptoms related to depression, but not considered as severity measures, for instance, paranoia or obsessive symptoms. The interpretation of the scores in HDRS is 0-7 is normal, 8-16 is mild depression, 17-23 is moderate depression, and greater than 24 is considered as severe depression [30].\n\n\nSmart Watch Sensors\n\nA smartwatch is similar to the wristwatch in appearance, but does so many things other than keep time. The digital smartwatches, Bluetooth is enabled, and the features can be extended to smartphones. In such cases, the users can use the smartwatch for reading the messages, answer \n\n\nDataset Description\n\nWe have collected data from 500 average aged people who complained about mood swings.

The questionnaire consists of 21 items to rate the severity of depression. Among the 21 items, 17 are severity measures for the depression while the remaining four are symptoms related to depression, but not considered as severity measures, for instance, paranoia or obsessive symptoms. The interpretation of the scores in HDRS is 0-7 is normal, 8-16 is mild depression, 17-23 is moderate depression, and greater than 24 is considered as severe depression [30].\n\n\nSmart Watch Sensors\n\nA smartwatch is similar to the wristwatch in appearance, but does so many things other than keep time. The digital smartwatches, Bluetooth is enabled, and the features can be extended to smartphones. In such cases, the users can use the smartwatch for reading the messages, answer phone calls, check the weather, and many advanced features [12]. In addition to these benefits, the smartwatches help in analyzing the behavior of the wearer and determine their mental health. The smartwatch has two sensors, Accelerometer and Gyroscope [13] for recording the data from the gestures that the wearer makes. The accelerometer is used in the smartwatches to detect the movement and orientation of the wearer. With accelerometer in the smartwatch, around two dozens of gestures and actions are detected, irrespective of one or two hands [20]. These gestures are later mapped to the controls or software applications. The typical variation used in the smartwatch is the Tri-axial, which keeps track of the physical activities of the wearers. Unlike the uniaxial variation, which records only the up and down movements, the Tri-axials record up and down, side-to-side, and back-and-forth movements [18].\n\n\nGyroscope\n\nGyroscope sensors are also used to measure the orientation and the angular velocity of the wearer. Gyroscope sensors have advanced functionalities than the accelerometers. These sensors can track the lateral and also the tilt orientations. On the other hand, accelerometers can track only the linear motions [31]. The design of the gyroscope has a rotating disk called the motor, which is mounted on a spinning axis. This sensor determines the orientation of the wearer with the help of Earth's gravitational force [32].\n\n\nHeart-Rate Monitor\n\nThe heart-rate monitors used in the smartwatches are designed based on a principle called Photo Plethysmography (PPG) [32]. PPG is the process of sending a shining light through the skin and measuring the scattered amount in the blood. The scattering is based on the blood flow dynamics such as the blood volume or the pulse rate. The three essential components in measuring the heart-rate are Optical Emitter (LEDs to send the light), Digital Signal Processor (captures the refracted light from the user and converts them into heart rate data), and Accelerometer (used in combination with the DSP in measuring the motions). With the help of DSP and Accelerometer data, the calories burned, blood pressure, and oxygen levels in the blood can also be measured [12].\n\n\nPre-Processing\n\nData pre-processing is a technique to remove the missing values and irrelevant values from the data. Data collected from various sources will usually have missing values, redundant and irrelevant data, which will reduce the prediction accuracy of the model [33]. It is essential to clean the data before applying any algorithm to improve the performance of the model [34].\n\nIn this study, we have used a single imputation method, which is mean imputation. In mean imputations, the missing values in certain features will be replaced by taking the mean of the available values in the feature column [35]. This is a simple yet effective method for handling missing values.\n\n\nFeature Selection\n\nFeature selection is also a part of pre-processing, where the number of features in the original dataset is reduced [36]. The reason for performing feature selection is to avoid features that do not affect the target variable [37]. Feature selection is a critical phase in any machine learning process, which significantly impacts the performance of the model. Partially irrelevant or irrelevant features are considered to negatively impact the model accuracy [38]. It is the process of selecting (automatically or manually) the critical feature that contributes more to the target variable or prediction variable [39]. If the model learns from the data that has missing values and irrelevant values, then the model would become weak.\n\nIn this study, we have used a correlation-based feature selection method to remove the features that interact the most and not having any part in the classification or prediction process. The correlation-based feature selection technique will identify the best possible subset from the whole feature set that might have a potential impact on the model outcome. The features are eliminated based on their inter-feature correlation threshold. This technique takes into consideration the individual attribute abilities and the redundancy among them with the help of merits score of subsets [40].\n\n\nMachine Learning Models\n\nMachine learning is one of the applications of Artificial Intelligence, which makes the system capable of making its own decision by learning from past events, and also improve and adapt to future changes [8]. Based on the way of handling the data, machine learning mainly consists of three types. Primarily, Supervised Learning where the data is labeled, and the output is known already. Secondly, Unsupervised Learning where the data is unlabelled, and the output is decided later from the inferences. Finally, Reinforcement Learning, which is based on the feedback mechanism, the algorithm is in such a way that it interacts with the environment, finds the rewards or errors [8,20].\n\nIn this study, we have implemented two supervised machine learning methods: Logistic Regression and Random Forest, along with the proposed weighted average ensemble model. Logistic Regression is a statistical method usually used in cases where the target variable is categorical (i.e., dichotomous, 1 or 0) [41]. It is used widely for predictive analysis also to interpret the relationship between one binary variable that is dependent and other independent or nominal variables. The logistic regression is represented by a sigmoidal curve [42]. Figure 2 shows a sample sigmoidal curve where 'x' can be any dependent attribute; if the curve goes towards the positive side, then the prediction becomes 1. If it goes towards negative, then the prediction becomes 0. The logistic regression equation is given by [43],\nP(A) = 1 1 + e −(a 0 +a 1 B)(1)\nwhere, Random forest is the most widely used machine learning model that can be used for both regression and classification. Random forest is an ensemble of several decision trees, and the prediction is made as a result of taking an average of all the predictions from the decision trees [44]. The random forest has a root node which separates the sample classes, which is further divided into  Random forest is the most widely used machine learning model that can be used for both regression and classification.

The random forest has a root node which separates the sample classes, which is further divided into several branches [45]. The classifications are done using the training data, and the predictions are accomplished using the testing data. Figure 3 represents a sample schematic of the random forest approach.

Also, we have implemented the weighted average method by combing the Logistic Regression model and the Random Forest model to improve the prediction accuracy. Two is always better than Also, we have implemented the weighted average method by combing the Logistic Regression model and the Random Forest model to improve the prediction accuracy. Two is always better than one. A weighted average is considered to be an extension to the average method where multiple predictions are made on the data points, and then an average of all the predictions would be taken as the final prediction value. On the other hand, in the weighted average, each data point would be given a pre-defined weight in order to show their importance in the prediction, and then the weighted average of all the data points is considered to be the final prediction. In a weighted ensemble, each member of the ensemble contributes to the final prediction. In the case of class label prediction, the mode of the predictions by the members is used for final prediction. In the case of class probability prediction, argmax of the summed probabilities of every class label is used for the final prediction.\n\n\nP(A)-Is the probability of A (Dependent Variable\n\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe dataset consists of 500 records combining the questionnaire and smartwatch encompassing the heart monitor sensor data. Of the 500 data, we have rejected 50 due to technical errors and used 450 records. The 450 records are pre-processed using mean imputation technique to handle all the missing values in the accelerometer data from smartwatch data as well as the questionnaire data. After correcting the missing values, the feature selection technique is employed. The feature selection technique is applied to data from the questionnaire and also the accelerometer data from a smartwatch. The data is segregated into a training set and testing set where the training is done with the training set, and the predictions are made using the testing set. The composition of training and testing data is 80% and 20% with 10-Fold cross-validation.\n\nThe selected features from the questionnaire excluding the Outcome feature, which is the Target variable, is:\n\n\n1.\n\nFeeling Sad 2.\n\nFeeling Irritable 3.\n\nFeeling Anxious about Tense 4.\n\nResponse to Mood to Good or Desired Events 5.\n\nThe mood in Relation to the Time of Day Along with the nine features from the questionnaire and six from the accelerometer heart rate from the heart rate monitor, there are totally 16 features selected by the correlation-based feature selection technique.\n\nAfter removing the missing values and selecting the critical features, two machine learning techniques are implemented, Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The classifiers are evaluated using Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, and cut-off points along with the AUC-ROC Curve (Area under the Receiver Optimization Characteristics). Confusion Matrix is a table used for evaluating a model whose truth-values are known. The confusion matrix consists of features such as Accuracy, Specificity, Sensitivity, Precision, and Recall. The formula and definition of confusion matrix features are given in Table 1. We have utilized the AUC-ROC curve, too, which is the most critical metric for evaluating the performance of the classification model. In AUC-ROC, AUC is the measure or degree of separability and ROC is the probability curve. When the model generates higher AUC, it implies that the model is efficiently classifying the patients without disease and with disease. The AUC-ROC curve is plotted with the True Positive Rate (TPR) on the y-axis against the False Positive Rate (FPR) on the x-axis. AUC-ROC says the capability of the model in differentiating the classes. \n\n\nConfusion Matrix Definition Formula\n\nAccuracy It is the ratio of correctly classified to the whole set. For instance, which answers the question: How many patients did we correctly diagnosed as depressed out of all the patients?\n\nTN + TP/All Precision It is the ratio of correctly classified positive subjects to all the positive subjects. For instance, which answers the question: How many of the patients whom we named as depressed are actually depressed?\nTP/TP + FP Sensitivity (Recall)\nIt is the ratio of correctly classified positive subjects to all those who have the disease in reality. Which answers the question: Of all the depressed people in the dataset, how many did we correctly predict as depressed?        Figure  9, we observe that the Weighted Average Ensemble model shows better results when compared to Logistic Regression and Random Forest Approaches.    The values of the confusion matrix for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Weighted Average Ensemble Models are given in Table 2. From this table, we can realize that the performance of the Random Forest machine learning model is more accurate and useful than the Logistic Regression model. Random Forest Approach is 98% accurate, and Logistic Regression Model is considerably less, which is 93% accuracy. We can also notice that the Weighted Average Ensemble model performs marginally better than the two models implemented individually. We found out that, in the Weighted Average Ensemble model, as the error rates are minimized, the algorithm provides faster results than the individual implementations of Logistic Regression and Random Forest Approaches.  \n\n\nConclusions and Future Work\n\nIn this study, we have implemented the machine learning models to diagnose Clinical Depression at the earliest possible time.

We have used accelerometer sensor data and combined it with the features from the questionnaire. We have used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as a questionnaire, but it is subjective data, hence why we used the smartwatch sensor data, which was attached to the wrists of patients. The data collected are pre-processed using the mean-imputation technique, and then correlation-based feature selection technique is applied separately on questionnaire data, and accelerometer data and then the selected features are combined together, and then Logistic Regression and Random Forest machine learning models are applied on the features and then combined the two models to form a Weighted Average ensemble model. For evaluating the implemented model, we have employed Confusion Matrix and Area under the Receiver Optimization Characteristics, and the results show that the Random Forest model performs better in predicting the depressed patients than the Logistic Regression model and the Weighted Average Ensemble performs better than the two models.\n\nIn this implementation, we have considered only the accelerometer sensor of the smartwatch. The accelerometer will help in orientation only when the object is relative to the earth's surface. For instance, when the object is under free fall, accelerometer data will show zero acceleration. The other sensor which is used in the smartwatches is the Gyroscope, which will sense rotation and movements that are not relative to the earth's surface. In our future works, we will consider both the sensors of the smartwatch for better accuracy and employ various other machine learning models to explore this area of research further. \n\nFigure 1 .\n1Architectural Diagram of the Proposed Model.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1Architectural Diagram of the Proposed Model.\n\n) a 0 -of 17 Figure 2 .\n0172moves the curve right and left a 1 -Slope B-Nominal Variable or Independent Variable.
